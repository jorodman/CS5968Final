He was among the first generation of artists to come out of the Osogbo School of Art in the 1960s. He was a drummer and actor with the theatre company of Duro Ladipo . He taught traditional music and dance at Obafemi Awolowo University from 1976 to 1987. As a musician, he trained in the dùndún ( talking drum ) and the Batá drum . He was the chief of his hometown Iragbiji . Early life [ edit ] Muraina Oyelami was born on 21 February 1940 [1] in Iragbiji , Osun State . [2] Drumming, theatre and arts [ edit ] From 1963 to 1965, Oyelami undertook training in the dùndún ( talking drum ) from Oba Laoye, who was Timi of Ede . During the same time, he studied the Batá drum with Ayantunji Amoo of Okinni and Abeyefo of Iseyin . [3] He was a drummer and actor with the Duro Ladipo National Theatre, the theatre company of Yoruba dramatist Duro Ladipo . [2] He toured Europe as a member of the troupe, first to Germany for the Berlin Festival of Art in 1964 and then to the United Kingdom for the Commonwealth Arts Festival in 1965. [4] "Georgina never told us what to paint; she just gave us materials and we didn't know what she was looking for. But we loved doing it...We never saw so much paint, so much color...The art workshop was a wonderful experience, because it taught us to see our own potential. I think that I can say that Bisi Fabunmu, Rufus, Twins Seven-Seven and myself, each discovered a new dimension in ourselves...Making a painting is really like going into a strange place, like an unknown territory and then you have nothing but your own integrity to guide you...The importance of the art workshop to us was that it gave us a sense of our own identity." [5] Muraina Oyelami In 1964 Oyelami attended the summer art school of the Mbari Mbayo Artists and Writers Club in Osogbo [2] where he attended a painting workshop given by Georgina Beier. [5] He began studying at the Osogbo Art School, founded by Georgina and Ulli Beier , and was among the first generation of Osogbo Art students; at the school he took printmaking and painting workshops in addition to working as a stage actor and master Yoruba drummer. [6] In his visual art, Oyelami drew inspiration from the works of Kenyan printmaker Hezbon Owiti. [2] At his first exhibition in Edinburgh in 1967 his works were compared to those of Paul Klee and Amedeo Modigliani , though he was unfamiliar with European art. [2] [5] He was later compared to Georges Rouault [6] and attended the printmaking workshops of Ru Van Rossem in 1966 and 1972. [7] Oyelami attended the University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University ) in Ile-Ife , studying technical theatre with a specialisation in theatre design [6] and received a certificate in dramatic arts. [7] In 1973 he traveled to the New York where he had a fellowship and residency at the National Black Theatre in Harlem . [4] Oyelami taught traditional music and dance at Obafemi Awolowo University from 1976 to 1987. [6] [7] He was also a visiting professor at the University of Bayreuth , Germany. [3] Oyelami was also commissioned to create mosaics for Obafemi Awolowo University. His first pair of mosaics, on the Faculty of Health Science building in Ile-Ife, were completed in 1975. He completed a mosaic mural on the Iragbiji campus at Wema Bank Plc. in 1983. [4] Oyelami plays both traditional and fusion music [4] and was a featured artist on the German band Embryo 's 1985 album Embryo & Yoruba Dun Dun Orchester . [8] He was the musical director for and composed the score to the 1998 Royal Exchange Theatre production of the Wole Soyinka play Death and the King's Horseman . [4] Oyelami is chief of his village, [6] having been made Eesa of Iragbiji [9] on 14 February 1993. [4] In 2018, Oyelami founded the Abeni Visual and Performing Art Institute in Iragbiji. He serves as artistic director of the school. [10] The institute trains students in visual and performing arts, including drum making, textile design and printmaking. [11] [12] Painting [ edit ] As a first-generation member of the Osogbo Art School, [11] Oyelami is considered part of the Osogbo Art movement. His style is considered Modernist , [10] with his oil paintings displaying a direct sense of design, and a juxtaposition of subtle muted colours with strong lines. [2] [7] Oyelami's themes are influenced by Yoruba culture , [6] and the subject matter of his landscapes and portraits are often derived from daily life and individuals. [7] Oyelami's early oil paintings involved abstract representations of life in the city, [2] while by the 1980s his work had become more figurative, trending towards more generic themes. [2] Oyelami has participated in dozens of solo and group exhibitions. His works are included in a number of collections. His 1971 painting Birds in the Garden is part of the collection of the Smithsonian Institution 's National Museum of African Art in Washington, D.C. [6] [7] Oyelami's 1971 painting Village on the Hillside is in the Tyler Collection of Romanian and Modern Art at the University of Tasmania . [13] His works are also in the collections of the National Gallery of Modern Art in Lagos, the Studio Museum in Harlem , at the Lagos State House of Assembly , the private collection of Bola Ige , the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, and the Staatlichen Kunsthalle in Berlin. [6] Oyelami's works accompanied those from the collection of Susanne Wenger in a 2016 exhibition that served as a tribute to her life. [14] In 2017, his works were shown at an exhibition of Osogbo art in the United States [9] and at Art Dubai . [15] Publications [ edit ] Oyelami has written books on drumming and Yoruba culture. The 1993 monograph Abefe: An Autobiography of Muraina Oyelami was based on interviews of Oyelami, edited by Ulli Beier. In the text, Oyelami describes his youth, theatre in Ile-Ife, the Mbari-Mbayo workshop, and his residencies at Iwalewa-Haus. [16] Oyelami, Muraina (1982). My Life in the Duro Lapido Theatre .
