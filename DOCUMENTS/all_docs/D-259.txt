[2] Education [ edit ] Furutani-Seiki was educated at the Yamaguchi University [3] School of Medicine , Japan where he was awarded Doctor of Medicine (M.D) in 1985. [4] [5] [6] He completed his postgraduate study at the Department of Immunology , Graduate School of Medicine , University of Tokyo , Japan where he was awarded a Ph.D in Immunology supervised by the late Tomio Tada [7] [8] in 1989. [9] Career and research [ edit ] Furutani-Seiki started his career in 1992, as a postdoc in Janni Nusslein-Volhard's lab at Max-Planck-Institute in Tübingen , he conducted a genome -wide mutagenesis [10] screen using medaka fish as a group leader of the Kondoh Differentiation Signalling ERATO project. [11] [12] [9] In 2007, he moved to University of Bath , UK, Centre for Regenerative Medicine [13] as a Medical Research Council Senior Research Fellow and continues his research at Yamaguchi University School of Medicine, Japan. [14] [9] [15] Furutani-Seiki research study investigates the molecular mechanisms of mechono-homeostasis in which extracellular mechanical cues are integrated with cell differentiation and proliferation to maintain tissue, organ and body form. [16] As part of his contribution to the field of Science, Furutani-Seiki discovered a single gene whose product is essential for the body and organs to keep their 3D shape and withstand external forces such as gravity. [17] [18] The gene was discovered through the analysis of a medaka fish mutant with a unique flattened phenotype which was identified by the combination of the mutagenesis screen in zebrafish with another screen in medaka fish. [19] [10] [20] [21] [22] [23] His work further investigates the single cell lineage and regionalisation of cell populations during medaka neurulation. [17] [24] Furutani-Seiki led an international team of researchers from the University of Bath, UK Centre for Regenerative Medicine that identified a gene that helps the body resist gravity and demonstrated what happens when the system goes wrong. [25] His research contribution covers gravity response, mechanohomeostais, organoid , immunology , [26] cancer , [27] 3D organogenesis , [28] regeneration [29] and developmental genetics ; [30] amongst others. [5] [31] Awards and honours [ edit ] Furutani-Seiki is an alumnus of Kavli Frontiers of Science [32] and a member of the editorial board of Regenerative Medicine Research . [33] He's also a Senior Research Fellow UK of the Medical Research Council (MRC). [9] He's also a professional member of the American Association of Cancer Research [34] and the Molecular Biology Society of Japan. [34] References [ edit ] ^ Taniguchi, Masaru (July 1, 2010).
