 Geoffrey Bilson (27 January 1938 – 25 July 1987) was a Welsh Canadian academic and author. Between 1964 to 1987, Bilson worked for the University of Saskatchewan in their history department as a professor . During this time period, Bilson primarily released children's books while also publishing non-fiction books. Some of the topics that Bilson wrote about include the Boston Massacre , cholera and the Winnipeg general strike . Following his 1987 death, his non-fiction book titled The Guest Children was released in 1988. The following year, the Geoffrey Bilson Award was first presented by the Canadian Children's Book Centre . Early life and education [ edit ] Bilson's birth occurred at Cardiff , Wales on 27 January 1938. [1] During his childhood, Bilson lived in Liverpool . [2] After he became interested in journalism, Bilson worked in newspaper publishing and editing while completing his education. [3] For his post-secondary education, Bilson first attended Aberystwyth University . Throughout the 1960s to 1970s, Bilson also went to the University of Omaha and Stanford University . [4] While at Omaha during 1961, the University of California, Berkeley gave Bilson a graduate assistant position. [5] Career [ edit ] Academics and publications [ edit ] During his tenure between 1964 to 1987, Bilson worked at the University of Saskatchewan as a professor . For his academic career, Bilson focused on historical events throughout North America. [6] [1] While at Saskatchewan, his articles about cholera were released in the 1970s and 1980s. [7] [8] For a 1984 book by Charles G. Roland, Bilson wrote about Canadian healthcare for immigrants. [4] The following year, Bilson's journal article on Frederick Montizambert was published. [9] Bilson had continued studying healthcare for immigrants before he died in 1987. [4] Writings [ edit ] As a writer, Bilson had a book in 1977 about the 1770 Boston Massacre . [10] [11] Bilson's book, A Darkened House: Cholera in 19th Century Canada , was made available in 1980. [12] When his kids left the country for a vacation, Bilson decided to become a children's author. His first two written books for children were released out of order. [13] In 1981, Bilson's first published book for children was Goodbye Sarah . [14] After Bilson converted his 1919 Winnipeg general strike work into a stage production, Goodbye Sarah was performed in 1984. [15] In 1982, Bilson continued his children's writings with Death Over Montreal . [16] To make the book, Bilson used his previous research he performed for A Darkened House . [17] In Death Over Montreal , Bilson wrote about a Scottish family experiencing cholera after moving to Canada. [18] With his 1984 children's work titled Hockeybat Harris , Bilson wrote about a Guest Child who moved from Great Britain to live in Canada during World War II . [19] In the late 1980s, Bilson had begun writing a children's book about "a sort of conventional child who wants things to go right". [20] Bilson's non-fiction book, The Guest Children: The Story of the British Child Evacuees Sent to Canada during World War II , was posthumously released in 1988. [1] [21] Writing style and themes [ edit ] While raising a family, Bilson used ideas provided by his children to create bedtime stories . [22] [13] To create his children's books, Bilson handwrote his manuscripts before he typed them up. During the editing stage, he wrote on his physical copies. [22] For his children's books, Bilson used "lesser-known...events and showed how they influenced the lives of young teenagers." [23] Bilson wrote the draft of his cholera book for children under the title of Yellow Flags in Montreal . The title was changed to Death Over Montreal after a book with a similar name was released before Bilson's book. [24] In his written draft, Bilson "wanted both parents to die from cholera" in the book. He later edited his book to only include the death of the main character's father. [17] To create The Guest Children , Bilson conducted interviews with fourteen former Guest Children and incorporated their recollections. He also added the background of the Overseas Reception Board project for the book. [25] Death and personal life [ edit ] Prior to his death, Bilson was experiencing brain cancer . [4] He had two children during his marriage. On 25 June 1987, Bilson's death occurred in Saskatoon . [11] Honours [ edit ] A year after his death, the Canadian Children's Book Centre began presenting the Geoffrey Bilson Award . [26] During the early 1990s, the Geoffrey Bilson Memorial Lecture was created. [27] Leading up to the 2020s, some of the scheduled speakers for the Saskatchewan lecture included Janet Lunn and Bathsheba Demuth . [28] [29] References [ edit ] ^ a b c Peacock, Scot, ed. (1998).
