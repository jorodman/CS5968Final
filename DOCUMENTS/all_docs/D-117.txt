History [ edit ] Grain elevator and oil cars in Creelman The Canadian Pacific Railway (C.P.R.) constructed a line in a southeasterly direction from Regina. Completed in 1904 the line was soon lined with a series of small communities and post offices. As early as 1903 a townsite was laid out on the line which locals decided to name Hazel. However, officials with the C.P.R. had other ideas and with the railway’s completion they renamed the tiny community Creelman after the company’s solicitor A.R. Creelman (that same year a post office was opened at the site). Gradually Creelman grew to become a thriving centre for the local farmers and would become an important market and social centre for the surrounding farming community. [5] Creelman incorporated as a village on April 6, 1906.
