Plot [ edit ] The story centers on Opus the Penguin (a main character of all three of Breathed's comic strips, and at the time appearing in Outland ). Opus is downhearted because, as a penguin, he cannot fly. He orders a machine and assembles it; when it comes time to test the machine by jumping off a three-mile-high cliff, Opus decides to do something less dangerous, and goes home to make anchovy Christmas cookies . He does not give up on his dream though, and makes a Christmas wish to Santa Claus for "wings that will go!" On Christmas Eve, Santa is making his usual delivery when he loses his reindeer and crashes into a lake. Opus jumps in and uses his natural swimming skills to pull Santa out. To thank Opus for his daring rescue, a group of ducks pick him up and take him flying through the air.

She also praised the animation and vocal performances. [2] Breathed, who was credited as the writer and executive producer of the special, was disappointed with the overall results. Asked in 2003 in The Washington Post where a copy of the special could be found on VHS or DVD: Breathed replied: Hopefully in the rubbish pail. We can do better than that and we will with an eventual Opus film... but I'm glad you enjoyed it. I presume your family was on speed when they watched it. I would imagine it helps. In a 2007 interview, Breathed said that the reason he disliked the special was simply "unspectacular ratings" and that his humor "wasn't meant for television, even if it was done right." He also blamed his own "lack of writing experience, as [he] wrote the script. And the director was way over his head." Breathed said that he had wanted Sterling Holloway to provide the voice for Opus. [5] According to a 2011 Breathed interview, the director inserted numerous inappropriate jokes into the special's background scenes.

"[T]he director, who was fired, managed to sprinkle a profane cornucopia of inappropriate flotsam around in the show.... Find a moldy DVD and check out the opening credit sequence: Watch the snowy hills during the pan. Some of them aren't hills. And that train track isn't really going into a train tunnel. Unless it's Sigmund Freud's. It's pretty funny now. Imagine how funny it was when we finally spotted it during final mixing, six days before network broadcast. Keep in mind, this was a Steven Spielberg production of a family Christmas show. I tried but failed to imagine Steven believing me when I tried to disclaim authorship of a woman's snow anus in the countryside. Or the sign in the window of the store that said "For sale cheap: Santa's Balls." Too late to change! This was the pre-digital age. We courageously let it go without telling anyone. I'm glad I'm telling this in a trade magazine and I can feel safe that it won't be going out on the Internet thing."
