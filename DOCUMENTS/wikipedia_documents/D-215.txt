History [ edit ] In 1976, a group of individuals with a forward-thinking outlook embarked on a project aimed at establishing a community radio station in Provincetown. Following the submission of an application to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the spring of the subsequent year, the initiative was met with opposition in court by a local commercial radio station and faced resistance from the newly established local newspaper of record, the Provincetown Advocate. Despite these challenges, the petition to deny the application was dismissed as lacking merit, leading to the issuance of a broadcasting license in 1980. In 2003, the station procured the Eastern Schoolhouse building which has since been its location of operation. Programming [ edit ] The station airs eclectic programming 24 hours a day, most of which is produced by 80 to 100 volunteers and three full-time staff members. The D.J.s program their own music, which includes folk , blues , classical , Americana , country , oldies , punk , funk , rock , jazz , indie pop , soul , celtic , bluegrass , dixieland , reggae and many forms of world music. In October 2009, WOMR replaced their analog transmitter with a digital/analog model. Spoken-word programs offer local-interest interviews and information about the arts , politics , food, the environment, wellness, and more. Additionally, the station broadcasts some nationally syndicated spoken-word content. With an emergency backup system, WOMR can stay on the air in power outages, bringing vital information to the Cape and South Shore communities. The station additionally sponsors a number of local events and nonprofits throughout the year. Funding [ edit ] WOMR currently operates on an annual budget of just under $600,000. Its funding sources include listener support across the Cape and in many off-Cape places (52%), an annual grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (16%), underwriting from local businesses (11%), fundraising events (10%), and rental income from art galleries in the Schoolhouse building in which the Provincetown studios are housed (11%). The station seeks listener support through on-air fundraisers and direct mailings asking for donations and additional member support. WOMR co-produces a benefit triathlon in Wellfleet during the second weekend in June in partnership with New England Endurance Events and produces, organizes, and hosts the annual Joe Gouveia Outermost Poetry Contest judged by Marge Piercy . Partnerships [ edit ] WOMR partners with local Cape Cod communities and community organizations, joining festivals and events across Cape Cod, occasionally with live remote broadcasts. The station often partners with the Payomet Performing Arts Center in Truro and with Wellfleet Preservation Hall to produce concerts and film events. In 2011–2015, film director Alan Chebot produced Outermost Radio , a film portraying the diversity of the station's programmers, and highlighting the challenges the station faced in 2012 when their main antenna toppled and needed to be replaced.
