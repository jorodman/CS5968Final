[3] Cash released it as a single (Columbia 4-44373, with "Roll Call" on the opposite side) [4] [5] [6] in November 1967. [7] The song made it to number 2 on U.S. Billboard ' s country chart [8] and to number 91 on the Hot 100 . [9] Years later the song was included on Johnny Cash's album International Superstar (1972). Analysis [ edit ] Cash wrapped up 1967 by releasing a version of the Carter sisters' "Rosanna's Going Wild," a song about a young woman who is out to experience life to the fullest. The song climbed the charts as 1967 turned into 1968, peaking at #2 in February. The B-side was "Roll Call," which tells of an army platoon losing their final battle, culminating in the attendant roll call in the beyond. Written by the Carter sisters, "Rosanna's Going Wild" was Cash's last single of 1967 and hit #2 by February of 1968. — C. Eric Banister. Johnny Cash FAQ: All That's Left to Know About the Man in Black [4] The success was completely unexpected: [10] During the Christmas holidays preceding the Folsom recording date, Cash's latest single "Rosanna's Going Wild" debuted on Billboard's country music charts. A jaunty tear through the teenage rebellion of a young girl, the song was nowhere near his best work: He sounded drawn, sapped perhaps by his drug battles and a vigorous fall touring slate. There was little reason to believe that the record's debut portended a climb to #1 [by Cash's future single " Folsom Prison Blues "] because Cash had not reached the top of the charts since mid-1964, when his macho " Understand Your Man " hammered a stake in the spot for six consecutive weeks. The singer's fallow period seems improbable today, when many just assume that Cash dominated country music between the ages of Hank Williams and Garth Brooks . But Cash had skidded into a long, flat dry spell. The four singles prior to "Rosanna" had flickered briefly on the country charts, and no Johnny Cash album containing new material had hit #1 since 1964. — Michael Streissguth.
