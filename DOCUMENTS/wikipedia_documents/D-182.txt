 Species of gastropod Ovachlamys fulgens A live individual of Ovachlamys fulgens , notice the caudal horn on the tail end of the foot Scientific classification Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Mollusca Class: Gastropoda (unranked): clade Heterobranchia clade Euthyneura clade Panpulmonata clade Eupulmonata clade Stylommatophora clade Sigmurethra clade limacoid clade Superfamily: Helicarionoidea Family: Helicarionidae Genus: Ovachlamys Species: O. fulgens Binomial name Ovachlamys fulgens ( Gude , 1900) [1] Synonyms Macrochlamys fulgens Gude, 1900 Ovachlamys fulgens is a species of air-breathing land snail , a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Helicarionidae . Ovachlamys fulgens was originally discovered and described as Macrochlamys fulgens by the British malacologist Gerard Pierre Laurent Kalshoven Gude in 1900. [1] Distribution [ edit ] The type locality for this species is Ryukyu Islands (Loo-Choo Islands). [1] The type specimens are stored in the Florida Museum of Natural History . [2] The snail is thought to be originally from the Ryukyu Islands . [3] Ovachlamys fulgens has spread to various countries, most probably accidentally introduced with the orchid trade. [4] Non-indigenous distribution of Ovachlamys fulgens include: Americas: Costa Rica [2] [3] The most frequent non-indigenous distribution has this species in Costa Rica. [4] USA : Miami-Dade County, Florida - it has been reported since 2003, but its wide distribution in the areas sampled strongly indicates that it has been established in southern Florida for some time. [4] Broward County, Florida [3] [5] - it has been reported since 2003. [4] Trinidad [3] [4] and Tobago [4] Colombia [4] Brazil - since 2015 [6] Pacific: Hawaii [4] Several Southeast Asian countries: Thailand [4] Singapore [4] This species is already established in the US, and is considered to represent a potentially serious threat as a pest , an invasive species which could negatively affect agriculture, natural ecosystems, human health or commerce. Therefore, it has been suggested that this species be given top national quarantine significance in the USA. [7] Description [ edit ] The drawings in the type description were created by the illustrator John Nugent Fitch and show apical, apertural and umbilical views of the shell of Ovachlamys fulgens . The shell of this species is perforate, trochoid , thin, shining, pellucid and dark corneous. [1] The spire is depressed. [1] The apex is obtuse. [1] Sutures are linear and margined. [1] The shell has four whorls , that are increasing rather suddenly. [1] The last whorl is convex and a little inflated and it is twice as wide as the penultimate whorl. [1] Whorls are finely striated, decussated by microscopic spiral lines. [1] The last whorl is not descending and it is slightly excavated in the umbilical region. [1] The aperture is slightly oblique, lunate. [1] The peristome is thin, straight, acute. [1] Margins of the aperture are distant, sub-parallel, the columellar margin a little reflected and nearly covering the very narrow umbilical perforation. [1] The width of the shell is 6–7 mm. [1] The height of the shell is 4,5 mm. [1] These snails are sometimes called "jumping snails" because the tail is modified with a caudal horn and the posterior part of the foot acts as a catapult to push off from contiguous substrates allowing the snail to suddenly move several inches.

Ecology [ edit ] The habitats of Ovachlamys fulgens include pastures and crop fields with enough moisture and with deep leaf litter cover. [2] For example, habitats with Yucca guatemalensis provide good conditions for this species. [2] The snails are mostly found in soil litter and on plants up to 8 feet in height in areas of secondary growth and tree plantations. [3] Ideal collecting time is after rainfall. [3] This species is considered an important orchid pest . [3] It is phytophagous [4] and is reported to attack a wide variety of horticultural plants, but the snails are mostly found among soil litter and become dormant during dry periods. [3] It has been found on avocado , mango , Heliconia and Dracaena . [3] Leaves of the avocado can be also used to raise juveniles in the laboratory. [8] Little scientific data has been gathered on the biology of this species. [3] Individuals of Ovachlamys fulgens can lay eggs at the age of 42 days and are considered mature when their shell width reaches 5.12 mm. [8] There is no need for the snails to mate in order to lay eggs and for successful reproduction. [8] Eggs are laid in clutches of three in soil or leaf litter where they absorb more water from the environment. [8] The lifespan of Ovachlamys fulgens is 9 months in the laboratory.
