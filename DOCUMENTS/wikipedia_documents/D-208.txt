The song features Snoop Dogg , and revolves around Kelly's efforts to leave the club with two women (hence, he's "doubling up"). "Double Up" was in contention to be the third single released off the album; however, the other contender, " Rock Star ," featuring Ludacris and Kid Rock , was chosen to be the third single. However, it reached number 1 on the Bubbling Under R&B/Hip-Hop Singles chart shortly after the album was released.
