On June 29, 2013, during the first half of Molde's home Tippeligaen match against Sarpsborg 08 , Gatt seriously injured his knee, ruling him out for the remainder of the season and requiring surgery. [8] Gatt also missed the entire 2014 season . After almost 21 months out injured, Gatt was finally cleared to play again on April 20, 2015.
