[4] History [ edit ] Early years [ edit ] Mint Condition was formed in the early 1980s. The band was originally made up of lead singer and (in-studio) drummer Stokley Williams , lead guitarist Homer O'Dell, and keyboardist Larry Waddell, Keyboardist/saxophonist Jeff Allen, keyboardist/percussionist/rhythm guitarist Keri Lewis, and bass guitarist Rick Kinchen.

Jam and Lewis signed Mint Condition to Perspective Records soon afterward. [1] Their debut album, Meant to Be Mint , was released on June 11, 1991 by Perspective. Afterward, they attempted to attract new jack swing listeners with their dance cut "Are You Free", which didn't see broad success with the song hitting #55 on the R&B charts. However, they did enjoy major success with the ballad " Breakin' My Heart (Pretty Brown Eyes) ," which stayed on the charts for 34 weeks, reaching the R&B top 5 (#3), and the Pop Top 10 (#6) and was certified gold by the RIAA. Their third single, "Forever In Your Eyes", was also a successful Top 10 R&B hit (#7 R&B). Two years later, they released their second album, From The Mint Factory (1993). They enjoyed success with the single " U Send Me Swingin' " which peaked at #2 on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Chart for four weeks straight in the spring of 1994. The song was also a hit on the Rhythmic Top 40 charts where it reached #14.

The single crept up to the number 2 spot on the Billboard R&B charts in a matter of weeks and was certified gold by the RIAA that December. "What Kind of Man Would I Be?" was so popular that it stayed on the Billboard R&B Charts for a total of 41 weeks before it finally fell off. "You Don't Have to Hurt No More", the second single released from Definition of a Band , was also a Top 10 R&B hit. (#10 R&B, #32 pop).

The second single, "Is This Pain Our Pleasure", peaked at #42, while also peaking at #34 on the R&B Airplay Charts. 2000s: Livin' The Luxury Brown and E-Life [ edit ] After a six-year hiatus, the group resurfaced as a quintet because Lewis left the group to produce for other artists, such as his ex-wife/singer Toni Braxton , and then joined the entertainment division at Santa Fe Station Casino.
