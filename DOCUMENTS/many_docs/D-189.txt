Critical reception [ edit ] Billboard ranked "Party" the fifth best collaboration song on Un Verano Sin Ti because it "works for so many reasons: an earworm chorus, the refreshing nu-disco undertones, two really fun and experimental artists working together. All elements combined make it a standout on the set. Fun fact: The loop/chorus "party party party party" is sung by singer-songwriter Elena Rose ." [3] Commercial performance [ edit ] After Un Verano Sin Ti was released, "Party" debuted at number 14 on the US Billboard Hot 100 dated May 21, 2022, becoming the fifth-highest charting track from the album behind the four American top-ten songs " Moscow Mule ", " Tití Me Preguntó ", " Después de la Playa " and " Me Porto Bonito " which peaked at number 4, 5, 6 and 10, respectively. [4] Additionally, it peaked at number 4 on the US Hot Latin Songs chart as well as peaking at number 8 on the Billboard Global 200 .
