Turks in Ireland ( Turkish : İrlanda Türkleri , Irish : Turcaigh in Éirinn ) are Turkish people who live in Ireland having been born elsewhere, or are Irish-born, but have Turkish roots. By Turkish roots, this could mean roots linking back to Turkey , the island of Cyprus or the communities of the Turkish diaspora . Population [ edit ] According to the 2011 Irish census, there are 1,029 Turkish nationals living in Ireland. [3] During the time of a 2005 strike against the GAMA Turkish Construction Company , socialist news websites reported that they alone employed 900 [4] [5] [6] to 2,000 [7] Turkish workers. The Turkish embassy may have an investment in down-playing the number of Turks in Ireland given the negative reception of Turks in other European countries , such as German Turks , Dutch-Turks and French-Turks . [2] Thus, overall the number of Turkish descendants living in Ireland is estimated at 2,000-3,000. [2] According to the information from Turkish Foreign Ministry on 06/02/2019, there are 4500 Turkish citizens living in the Republic of Ireland.
