Changes from last season [ edit ] Team changes [ edit ] Hapoel Iksal and Hapoel Kfar Shalem were promoted to Liga Leumit ; Hapoel Ashkelon and Hapoel Bnei Lod (both to South division) were relegated from Liga Leumit . Since the previous season was abandoned due to the COVID-19 pandemic , no team was relegated to Liga Bet . However Ironi Kiryat Gat and Hapoel Asi Gilboa folded and didn't register to this season. Maccabi Tzur Shalom and Maccabi Ironi Kiryat Ata merged in July 2020. [1] Ihud Bnei Majd al-Krum , Hapoel Bu'eine , Hapoel Bnei Fureidis , Maccabi Bnei Reineh , Tzeirei Tayibe (to the North division), F.C. Dimona and Ironi Kuseife (to the South Division) were promoted from Liga Bet to complete a 34 team line-up, 18 teams in each division. Format change [ edit ] To accommodate the shortened schedule caused by COVID-19 pandemic, the league was split into two phases. For the first phase each division was split to two sub-divisions with nine teams in each sub-division, to be played as a double round robin tournament (16 matches in total). At the end of the first phase in each division the two top teams from each sub-division qualifying to a promotion group of four teams, again to be played as a double round robin tournament (6 matches in total), with the winning team gaining promotion to Liga Leumit and the second-placed team qualifying to the promotion play-offs. The seven bottom placed teams in each sub-division would continue in their respective sub-division with the points gained during the first phase, playing an additional round robin schedule (six matches in total). The bottom team in each sub-division would be relegated to Liga Bet and the sixth placed team would compete to the relegation play-offs.
