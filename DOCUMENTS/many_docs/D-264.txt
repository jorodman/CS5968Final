[1] Alab Pilipinas is the fourth Philippine team to play in the ABL. [1] "Alab" is a Filipino word that translates as "blaze" in English. The team was originally known as Alab Pilipinas (2016-17 ABL season) as the fourth ABL team from the Philippines. From November 2017 to January 2018, it was known as Tanduay Alab Pilipinas , under the sponsorship of Tanduay Distillers, Inc . History [ edit ] "Alab Pilipinas" (top) and "Tanduay Alab Pilipinas" (bottom) logos Six of its original players are ABL veterans who had previously played for the Champion team San Miguel in the 2013 ABL season. The team staged their home games in venues located in Biñan, Laguna , Cebu , and Davao during the entire duration of their first season. [1] They organized several basketball clinics together with the local government units as part of the basketball grassroots development program. [2] The team was sponsored by liquor brand Tanduay and played as Tanduay-Alab Pilipinas [3] from November 2017 to January 2018. On February 1, 2018, San Miguel Corporation took over as the team's sponsor and was renamed San Miguel Alab Pilipinas. The sudden separation with Tanduay came about reportedly due to differences between the two parties in the handling of the team.
