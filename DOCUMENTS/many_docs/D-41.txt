 Bedfordshire County Cricket Club was established on 3 November 1899; prior to that a county club had existed before, with Bedfordshire competing in the first Minor Counties Championship in 1895. It has since played minor counties cricket from 1900 and played List A cricket from 1967 to 2005, using a different number of home grounds during that time. Their first home minor counties fixture in 1895 was against Hertfordshire at Bedford School , while their first home List A match came 72 years later against Northamptonshire in the 1967 Gillette Cup at Wardown Park, Luton . Bedfordshire have played the majority of their minor counties fixtures at Bedford School and Wardown Park.
