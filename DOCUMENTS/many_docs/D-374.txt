Also, 128-bit central processing unit (CPU) and arithmetic logic unit (ALU) architectures are those that are based on registers , address buses , or data buses of that size. While there are currently no mainstream general-purpose processors built to operate on 128-bit integers or addresses, a number of processors do have specialized ways to operate on 128-bit chunks of data. Representation [ edit ] A processor with 128-bit byte addressing could directly address up to 2 128 (over 3.40 × 10 38 ) bytes, [ original research? ] which would greatly exceed the total data captured, created, or replicated on Earth as of 2018, which has been estimated to be around 33 zettabytes (over 2 74 bytes). [1] A 128-bit register can store 2 128 (over 3.40 × 10 38 ) different values. The range of integer values that can be stored in 128 bits depends on the integer representation used. With the two most common representations, the range is 0 through 340,​282,​366,​920,​938,​463,​463,​374,​607,​431,​768,​211,​455 (2 128 − 1) for representation as an ( unsigned ) binary number , and −170,​141,​183,​460,​469,​231,​731,​687,​303,​715,​884,​105,​728 (−2 127 ) through 170,​141,​183,​460,​469,​231,​731,​687,​303,​715,​884,​105,​727 (2 127 − 1) for representation as two's complement . Quadruple precision (128-bit) floating-point numbers can store 113-bit fixed-point numbers or integers accurately without losing precision (thus 64-bit integers in particular). Quadruple precision floats can also represent any position in the observable universe with at least micrometer precision. [ citation needed ] Decimal128 floating-point numbers can represent numbers with up to 34 significant digits. History [ edit ] A 128-bit multicomparator was described by researchers in 1976. [2] The IBM System/360 Model 85 , [3] and IBM System/370 and its successors, support 128-bit floating-point arithmetic. The Siemens 7.700 and 7.500 series mainframes and their successors support 128-bit floating-point arithmetic. [4] Most modern CPUs feature single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) instruction sets ( Streaming SIMD Extensions , AltiVec etc.) where 128-bit vector registers are used to store several smaller numbers, such as four 32-bit floating-point numbers. A single instruction can then operate on all these values in parallel. However, these processors do not operate on individual numbers that are 128 binary digits in length; only their vector registers have the size of 128 bits. The DEC VAX supported operations on 128-bit integer ('O' or octaword) and 128-bit floating-point ('H-float' or HFLOAT) datatypes. Support for such operations was an upgrade option rather than being a standard feature. Since the VAX's registers were 32 bits wide, a 128-bit operation used four consecutive registers or four longwords in memory. The ICL 2900 Series provided a 128-bit accumulator, and its instruction set included 128-bit floating-point and packed decimal arithmetic. A CPU with 128-bit multimedia extensions was designed by researchers in 1999. [5] Among the sixth generation of video game consoles , the Dreamcast and the PlayStation 2 used the term "128-bit" in their marketing to describe their capability. The Playstation 2's CPU had 128-bit SIMD capabilities. [6] [7] Neither console supported 128-bit addressing or 128-bit integer arithmetic. Modern Graphics processing unit (GPU) chips may operate data across a 128-bit bus. [8] Hardware [ edit ] The RISC-V ISA specification from 2016 includes a reservation for a 128-bit version of the architecture, but the details remain undefined intentionally, because there is yet so little practical experience with such large word size. [9] Software [ edit ] In the same way that compilers emulate e.g. 64-bit integer arithmetic on architectures with register sizes less than 64 bits, some compilers also support 128-bit integer arithmetic. For example, the GCC C compiler 4.6 and later has a 128-bit integer type __int128 for some architectures. [10] GCC and compatible compilers signal the presence of 128-bit arithmetic when the macro __SIZEOF_INT128__ is defined. [11] For the C programming language , 128-bit support is optional, e.g. via the int128_t type, or it can be implemented by a compiler-specific extension. The Rust programming language has built-in support for 128-bit integers (originally via LLVM ), which is implemented on all platforms. [12] A 128-bit type provided by a C compiler can be available in Perl via the Math::Int128 module. [13] Uses [ edit ] The free software used to implement RISC-V architecture is defined for 32, 64 and 128 bits of integer data width. Universally unique identifiers (UUID) consist of a 128-bit value. IPv6 routes computer network traffic amongst a 128-bit range of addresses. ZFS is a 128-bit file system. 128 bits is a common key size for symmetric ciphers and a common block size for block ciphers in cryptography . The IBM i virtual instruction set defines all pointers as 128-bit. This gets translated to the hardware's real instruction set as required, allowing the underlying hardware to change without needing to recompile the software. Past hardware was 48-bit CISC , while current hardware is 64-bit PowerPC . Because pointers are defined to be 128-bit, future hardware may be 128-bit without software incompatibility. Increasing the word size can speed up multiple precision mathematical libraries, with applications to cryptography , and potentially speed up algorithms used in complex mathematical processing ( numerical analysis , signal processing , complex photo editing and audio and video processing ). MD5 is a hash function producing a 128-bit hash value. Apache Avro uses a 128-bit random number as synchronization marker for efficient splitting of data files.
