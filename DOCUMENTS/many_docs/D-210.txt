[1] Abe had only been elected to the post slightly less than a year earlier; his resignation came only three days after a new parliamentary session had begun. Abe said his unpopularity was hindering the passage of an anti-terrorism law, involving among other things Japan's continued military presence in Afghanistan. Party officials also said the embattled Prime Minister was suffering from poor health. [2] [3] Fukuda defeated Asō in the election, receiving 330 votes against 197 votes for Asō. [4] [5] Since the LDP had an absolute majority in the lower house, Fukuda became Prime Minister on 25 September 2007. [5] His principal rival, Tarō Asō , later succeeded him as prime minister after Fukuda's resignation in September 2008. Candidates [ edit ] Endorsement by at least twenty LDP lawmakers is necessary to become a candidate in the election. [1] Since there are 387 LDP Diet members and 141 prefectural LDP representatives (three for each of the 47 prefectural chapters), there is a total of 528 votes. [6] The following people were candidates in the election: Taro Aso , [7] LDP Secretary General; came in second to Abe in the 2006 leadership election and was initially rumored to be the most likely successor before Fukuda gathered support. [8] [9] He announced his candidacy on 13 September 2007. Yasuo Fukuda , [7] former Chief Cabinet Secretary under Yoshiro Mori and Junichiro Koizumi . He announced his candidacy on 15 September 2007. [10] People who were considered likely candidates, but refused to seek the nomination, were: Former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi , Abe's immediate predecessor, was also considered a possible candidate, but declined to seek the nomination. [1] He expressed his support for Fukuda on 14 September 2007. [11] The incumbent Minister of Finance Fukushiro Nukaga initially stated on 13 September 2007 he would run, [1] [12] [13] [14] but decided to support Fukuda on 14 September 2007 after he had a 40-minute meeting with him. [15] Sadakazu Tanigaki , a former Minister of Finance under Junichiro Koizumi , [12] and Taku Yamasaki , a former LDP Secretary General and the third candidate in the 2006 leadership election , [3] both announced their support for Fukuda on 14 September 2007, as did former LDP Secretary General Makoto Koga . [16] Kaoru Yosano , the incumbent Chief Cabinet Secretary , was also considered a likely candidate, [8] [12] but did not stand. Aso conceded on 16 September 2007 that he was unlikely to win the race and stated he was primarily continuing as a candidate to give party members a choice. [17] Fukuda had by that date gathered the official support of eight factions of the LDP, all except Aso's own faction; he furthermore stated he would not visit the controversial Yasukuni Shrine , [18] and proposed the construction of a secular national memorial facility instead. Aso stated that there could be no replacement for the shrine, but did not state whether he would visit the shrine if elected. [19] Fukuda struck a more conciliatory tone in relation to the North Korean abduction issue, while Aso positioned himself as a hardliner. [20] According to media surveys, Fukuda had 213 of the lawmakers on his side, while Aso had the assured support of 45 Diet members. [21] Observers agreed that Fukuda was almost certain to win due to the widespread support across faction borders he had obtained. [22] Fukuda received 330 votes in the election, held on 23 September, defeating Asō, who received 197 votes. [4] [5] The support from Diet members alone was enough for Fukuda to win the leadership in the first round.
