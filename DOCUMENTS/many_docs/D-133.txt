The cult drowns Yukito hoping he will be reborn as their next leader. Yukito earnestly wishes to be reborn in a world without religion. He awakens in a new world in an isolated village and makes friends with sisters Alura and Siluril, and farmers Clen and Roy. After a few weeks they visit the Imperial city so Alura and Roy can obtain pornographic magazines. Yukito witnesses a public mass suicide and learns without religion there is no fear of death, so when the government decides citizens are no longer of use or social deviants they proudly commit suicide. Alura and the villagers are all deviants who refused suicide due to fearing death. Alura was declared deviant due to her lustful personality. Alura and Silural disappear and Yukito learns outcasts can be executed at any time. Silural has already been hanged and while attempting to rescue Alura both she and Yukito are killed. Dying again, Yukita prays to Mitama who manifest as a young girl, having been impatiently waiting for him to summon her as the next cult leader. Mitama murders the government soldiers and resurrects Yukito and Alura, excited to be the only God of a brand new world. 2 "We know we are not worthy. O great Lord Mitama.

Unable to understand what a God is Alura jealously assume Mitama is Yukito’s lover. Fearing government revenge Yukito asks Mitama about her powers and is despondent to learn that due to having no believers in this new world she has no powers left. As there is a chance the government will send an army to their village Yukito needs to somehow get 10,000 people to worship Mitama and make her a God again. Roy, having discovered he enjoys masochism, becomes Mitama’s first believer when she treats him with disgust. Mitama is disappointed that Yukito still does not really believe in her. Mitama’s attempt to demonstrate her godly knowledge falls flat when she merely lists embarrassing events from Yukito’s childhood. Yukito also fails to inspire belief in the villagers using fortune-telling and magic tricks. Alura’s pet fox, Chilchil, dies from poison so Mitami uses the single spark of magic from Roy’s belief to resurrect Chilchil, causing both Alura and Siluril to believe. With some power returned Mitama agrees to Alura’s request to resurrect the soldiers she murdered, as they were innocent men following orders. The soldiers commander, Bertrandt, is furious when Mitama resurrects him as a woman. 3 Transcription: " Kakemakumokashikoki Mitamanoohomikami Takaamaharanotsukasanimashimashite Moromoronomagagoto Magatsuhi Tsumikegarewo Harahitamahekiyometamaheto Ohotsuchinomototsukami Mitama-no-mikoto Kikoshimeseto Kashikomi-kashikomimawosu " ( Japanese : カケマクモカシコキ ミタマノオホミカミ タカアマハラノツカサニマシマシテ モロモロノマガゴト マガツヒ ツミケガレヲ ハラヒタマヘキヨメタマヘト オホツチノモトツカミ ミタマノミコト キコシメセト カシコミカシコミマヲス ) Tatsuji Yamazaki Ohine Ezaki Tatsuji Yamazaki April 20, 2023 ( 2023-04-20 ) References [ edit ] ^ a b 宗教家の息子、神や宗教の概念がない世界へ転生…朱白あおい×半月板損傷の新連載 .
