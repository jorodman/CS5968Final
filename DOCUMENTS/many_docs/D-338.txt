[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] The design was developed into the O'Day 39 in 1982 for United States market. [1] [2] [9] Production [ edit ] The design was built by Jeanneau in France , from 1980 to 1986, with 651 boats completed. [3] [4] [8] [10] [11] [12] Design [ edit ] The Sun Fizz 40 is a recreational keelboat , built predominantly of polyester fiberglass , with wood trim. It has a masthead sloop rig, with a deck-stepped mast, two sets of unswept spreaders and aluminum spars with stainless steel 1X19 wire rigging. The hull has a raked stem , a reverse transom , an internally mounted spade-type rudder controlled by a wheel and a fixed fin keel or optional stub keel and retractable centerboard . The fin keel version displaces 16,094 lb (7,300 kg) and carries 6,614 lb (3,000 kg) of iron ballast, while the centerboard-equipped version displaces 17,086 lb (7,750 kg) and carries 7,385 lb (3,350 kg) of iron ballast. [1] [2] [3] [4] The keel-equipped version of the boat has a draft of 6.40 ft (1.95 m), while the centerboard-equipped version has a draft of 6.33 ft (1.93 m) with the centerboard extended and 4.25 ft (1.30 m) with it retracted, allowing operation in shallow water. [1] [2] [3] [4] The boat is fitted with a British Perkins Engines diesel engine of 40 or 50 hp (30 or 37 kW) for docking and maneuvering. The fuel tank holds 39.6 U.S. gallons (150 L; 33.0 imp gal) and the fresh water tank has a capacity of 185 U.S. gallons (700 L; 154 imp gal). [1] [2] [3] [4] The design has sleeping accommodation for nine people, with a double "V"-berth in the bow cabin, a "U"-shaped settee around a drop-down table and a straight settee in the main cabin and two aft cabins with a double berths. The galley is located on the port side just forward of the companionway ladder. The galley is "U"-shaped and is equipped with a two-burner stove, an ice box and a double sink. A navigation station is opposite the galley, on the starboard side. There are two heads , one just aft of the bow cabin on the port side and one on the starboard side in the aft cabin. Cabin headroom is 78 in (198 cm). [1] [2] [3] [4] For sailing downwind the design may be equipped with a symmetrical spinnaker of 1,184 sq ft (110.0 m 2 ). [1] [2] The design has a hull speed of 7.75 kn (14.35 km/h). [2] Operational history [ edit ] In 2012 the British publication Yachting Monthly used a Sun Fizz 40 in a series of survivability and crash tests .
