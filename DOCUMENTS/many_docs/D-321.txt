[4] [5] [6] History [ edit ] The firm was established in 1950 in Rye Lane, Peckham as "Lewis Silkin and Partners" by John Silkin, son of Lewis Silkin . Lewis himself joined the practice full-time in the 1950s after leaving the House of Commons and relinquishing some parliamentary duties he had undertaken on first becoming a peer. Lewis Silkin opened an office in Westminster in addition to the existing office in Peckham. The Peckham office was initially a general practice, providing 'high street' services. The Westminster office specialised in planning law and development permits. During his time in Government and as Minister of Town and Country Planning, Lewis Silkin had been known as the 'architect' of our town and country planning policies.

The firm works with leading businesses to protect their most important assets â€“ their ideas, their people, and their future. We call it Ideas. People. Possibilities. rockhopper [ edit ] In 2014 Lewis Silkin launched a low cost, fixed fee employment law service "rockhopper" [8] as a response to the potential loss of lawyers with caring responsibilities and client demand for cost-effective support.
