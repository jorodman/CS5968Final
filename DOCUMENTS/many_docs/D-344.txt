or fine, little-altered examples of some particular period, style or building type." [1] Category B : "buildings of regional or more than local importance; or major examples of some particular period, style or building type, which may have been altered." [1] Category C : "buildings of local importance; lesser examples of any period, style, or building type, as originally constructed or moderately altered; and simple traditional buildings which group well with other listed buildings." [1] In March 2016 there were 47,288 listed buildings in Scotland. Of these, 8% were Category A, and 50% were Category B, with the remaining 42% being Category C.
