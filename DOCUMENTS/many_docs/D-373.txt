A total of 80 percent of the funding came from the Federal Transit Administration , which included a $5 million State of Good Repair grant, while the remaining 20 percent came from the Delaware Transportation Trust Fund.

[8] The passenger canopy was completed by May 2018 while the visitor center was finished by mid-summer 2018.
