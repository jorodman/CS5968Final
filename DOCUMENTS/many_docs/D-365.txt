Danny Gabriel Carvajal Rodríguez ( Spanish pronunciation: [ˈdani kaɾβaˈxal] ; born 8 January 1989) is a Costa Rican footballer who plays for Japanese club FC Ryukyu as a goalkeeper . He was a Costa Rica national player for many championships. Club career [ edit ] Born in San Ramón , Carvajal was a Deportivo Saprissa youth graduate. [1] He made his first team debut for Brujas F.C. on 6 December 2009 by coming on as a second-half substitute in a 0–0 away draw against A.D. Ramonense . Carvajal started to appear more regularly during the 2010–11 season , contributing with 12 appearances. In July 2011, after leaving the club after the end of the campaign due to economic problems, he joined fellow league team A.D. San Carlos . [2] Carvajal was an undisputed starter for San Carlos during his two-year spell, and on 15 May 2013 he returned to Saprissa, now assigned to the first team. [1] Initially a backup to Donny Grant and Luis Ernesto Michel in his first campaign , he subsequently became first-choice and featured regularly in the following three years. On 29 June 2017, Carvajal moved abroad for the first time in his career, signing for Segunda División side Albacete Balompié [3] and becoming the third Costa Rican goalkeeper to represent the club (after Luis Conejo and Keylor Navas ). [4] The following 16 January, however, he was loaned to Tokushima Vortis until the end of the year. [5] International career [ edit ] Carvajal was called up to Costa Rica under-20s ahead of the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup , [6] but was only a backup to Esteban Alvarado during the tournament. In June 2011 he was included in the main side 's squad ahead of 2011 Copa América , [7] but again remained a second-choice to Alvarado. Carvajal was also called up to 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup , [8] Copa América Centenario , [9] 2017 Copa Centroamericana [10] and 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup , [11] mainly behind Alvarado and Navas. He only made his full international debut on 18 January 2017, starting in a 0–0 draw against Nicaragua .
