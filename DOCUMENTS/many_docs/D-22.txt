[2] Mount Emei sits at the western rim of the Sichuan Basin . The mountains west of it are known as Daxiangling . [3] A large surrounding area of countryside is geologically known as the Permian Emeishan Large Igneous Province , a large igneous province generated by the Emeishan Traps volcanic eruptions during the Permian Period . Administratively, Mount Emei is located near the county-level city of the same name ( Emeishan City ), which is in turn part of the prefecture-level city of Leshan . It was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. [4] As a sacred mountain [ edit ] Mount Emei is one of the Four Sacred Buddhist Mountains of China , and is traditionally regarded as the bodhimaṇḍa , or place of enlightenment, of the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra . Samantabhadra is known in Mandarin as Pǔxián Púsà ( 普賢菩薩 ). Sources of the 16th and 17th centuries allude to the practice of martial arts in the monasteries of Mount Emei, [5] which made the earliest extant reference to the Shaolin Monastery as the place of origin of Chinese martial arts. [6] Buddhist architecture on Emei [ edit ] This is the location of the first Buddhist temple built in China in the 1st century CE. [4] The site has seventy-six Buddhist monasteries of the Ming and Qing dynasties, most of them located near the mountain top. The monasteries demonstrate a flexible architectural style that adapts to the landscape. Some, such as the halls of Baoguosi, are built on terraces of varying levels, while others, including the structures of Leiyinsi, are on raised stilts. Here the fixed plans of Buddhist monasteries of earlier periods were modified or ignored in order to make full use of the natural scenery. The buildings of Qingyinge are laid out in an irregular plot on the narrow piece of land between the Black Dragon River and the White Dragon River . The site is large and the winding footpath is 50 km (31 mi) long, taking several days to walk. [7] Cable cars ease the ascent to the two temples at Jinding (3,077 m), an hour's hike from the mountain's peak. [2] [8] Climate [ edit ] The summit of Mount Emei has an alpine subarctic climate ( Köppen Dwc ), with long, cold (but not severely so) winters, and short, cool summers. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from −5.7 °C (21.7 °F) in January to 11.6 °C (52.9 °F) in July, and the annual mean is 3.07 °C (37.5 °F). Precipitation is common year-round (occurring on more than 250 days), but due to the influence of the monsoon , rainfall is especially heavy in summer, and more than 70% of the annual total occurs from June to September.
