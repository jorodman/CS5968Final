He was the royal purchasing agent in the Baltic from 1538 to 1559, chiefly tasked with supplying the English fleet with masts, cordage and other naval stores. [1] [2] Early life [ edit ] He was born in Shropshire , the son of John Watson. [3] He had two brothers, Richard and Roger and two sisters: Blanche (d. 1563), who married 1. Richard Reynolds (d. 6 May 1542); 2. Robert Palmer (d. 1544); 3. William Forman (d. 1546); and Elizabeth, who married Richard Mawdley. [4] [5] [6] Career [ edit ] Watson was a member of the Worshipful Company of Drapers . [3] In 1538 Watson was appointed royal purchasing agent in the Baltic . [1] He had been a Baltic merchant since at least 1531. [1] His brothers, Richard and Roger worked with him. [4] [5] In 1544 William Watson wrote to Duke Albrecht of Prussia from Danzig : "My brother Richard asked me in a letter to send some English dogs to Your Grace. I have ordered some, and they have been put on board a vessel. Of these three one jumped overboard; the other two can be fetched from Jurgen Rudloff, the skinner. In case Your Grace wanted more, it would be well to let me know if You want them young or old. I shall then willingly order them." He also offered to procure court dresses or dress material for the Duke. [4] William's brother, Roger, who lived in Danzig and acted as his agent there, married, before 1550, Margarethe von Schwarzwald, the daughter of Hans von Schwarzwald (1468–1521), alderman of Danzig and his third wife, Margarethe von Reesen. [1] [5] [7] In 1546, through William Watson's mediation, Henry VIII negotiated with the Danzig city council for the purchase of masts, cordage and other naval stores and in 1558 Mary I negotiated with the king of Poland, Sigismund II Augustus , to allow Watson to export essential materials for the English fleet from Danzig free of customs duty. [8] William Watson was briefly succeeded as Crown agent in Danzig by John Borthwick in 1560 and then from 1561, the London leather merchant, Thomas Allen, who was later a member of the Eastland Company . [9] Marriages [ edit ] Watson married three times. By his first (unidentified) wife, he had a daughter: [6] Barbara, married Thomas Haselfoote.

His third wife, Anne Lee (d. 1561), was the daughter of Thomas Lee (d.1527) and Elizabeth Rolleston (d.1556), the daughter of Thomas Rolleston of Swarkestone in Derbyshire and widow of William Whitlock (d.1520). [10] With Anne he had two sons and four daughters: [6] William (1553–12 Oct. 1624) Thomas (1555–1592) , poet and translator.
