The term is derived from herpetology - the branch of zoology dealing with the study of those organisms. Herpetological societies are typically non-profit, private organizations in which members pay dues for the benefit of the group. In general they are geographically focused around a specific state, province, or region, but most groups accept members from anywhere in the world. A few groups devote their endeavors to the most technical and scientific aspects of herpetology as a science, and therefore require academic or professional credentials of their members. However, most clubs are open to the public, having been founded by hobbyists and non-professionals to promote education and conservation while often sharing knowledge related to husbandry and breeding.
