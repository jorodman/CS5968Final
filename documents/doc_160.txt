[2] [3] Education [ edit ] Singh was educated at St John's Beaumont School , Charterhouse School and the Licensed Victuallers' School . Numerous articles have described Singh as a Harvard graduate. [4] [3] [5] [6] Singh's 2019 profile in Forbes 30 Under 30 - Europe - Art & Culture , listed a Bachelor of Arts/Science from Harvard University , [7] however by May 2021, the educational section of his profile had been removed. [8] Career [ edit ] In 2016, Singh set up a feminist art gallery called Amar Gallery, in London. [9] The gallery exhibited the work of female artists and feminists including the Guerrilla Girls , Helen Frankenthaler , and Renee Cox . [10] [11] [12] Singh closed his North London gallery in April 2019 and the company was dissolved in October 2021. [1] In 2019, Singh had stated his next venture, set to open October 2019, was Curated Golden Square, described as a "$100 million, 30,000 square foot apartment hotel". [13] [12] In a 2021 follow up interview with Vanity Fair, Singh claimed that the COVID-19 pandemic was the reason the venture did not move forward. [14] The site in question, 37 Golden Square , is a collection of 23 apartments developed by Halamar in 2019. [15] In November 2021, Artnet claimed that the value of Singh's NFT deals was in excess of $300 million. [16] Business Insider claimed that Singh's NFT art gallery booked $9.8 million in revenue in 2021. [17] In February 2022, Vanity Fair claimed that Singh had secured $500 million of NFT deals in the prior 12 months, and was on track to secure $1 billion in NFT deals by 2024. [18] In June 2022, PinkNews claimed that Singh's wholly owned NFT studio was worth over $150 million. [19] Philanthropy [ edit ] In 2021, Singh pledged to donate $5 million worth of art by female, LGBTQ and minority artists to museums worldwide by 2025. [20] [21] In January 2021, Singh donated a painting worth six figures celebrating women by the artist María Berrío to Los Angeles County Museum of Art , [20] and a portrait of inaugural poet Amanda Gorman to Harvard University's permanent collection, valued at £8,000. [22] [20] Singh claims he reached $5 million of donations by July 2022. [23] In June 2021, Singh partnered with Givenchy and VeVe to raise $128,000 for LGBT+ youth movement Le MAG Jeunes LGBT+ , by collaborating with artists Rewind Collective and selling the first NFT created for a beauty brand. [24] [25] [26] In 2022, he pledged to donate $1 million over two years to non-governmental organization Vital Voices . [27] He is a patron of the Tate , Serpentine Galleries and Whitechapel Gallery , and a member of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art collectors committee. [28] Activism [ edit ] Singh has worked alongside the LGBT+ community in India to fight for equal rights, and through his gallery also mounted LGBT+ exhibitions including Links by artist Howard Tangye and Section 377, an online exhibition celebrating the road to India legalising homosexuality. Alongside Prince Manvendra Singh Gohil and other LGBT+ activists, Singh has called for the Indian government to strike down Section 377 , [2] legalise same-sex marriage and same-sex adoption , and ban LGBT conversion therapy practices. [2] [9] In July 2019 Singh spoke at the Congressional Hispanic Leadership Institute 's Annual Future Leaders Conference, held at the Russell Senate Office Building , about women's rights and how communities are impacted through art and culture. [20] [29] Ancestry [ edit ] Singh is a descendant of Raja Nihal Singh of Kapurthala . [30] In 2017, Singh was 16th in line to the former throne of Kapurthala, [4] one of 565 princely states which existed during the British Raj , and which was abolished in 1947 following Indian independence. A 2017 Los Angeles Blade article incorrectly reported that Indian politician Vishvjit Singh was Singh's paternal uncle; [3] Vishvjit was in fact Singh's paternal grandfather's nephew. [31] A 2022 Esquire interview with Singh contained the incorrect assertion that Indian Health Minister Amrit Kaur was Singh's grandmother; [23] Kaur never married and died without children.
