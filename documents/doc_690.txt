He is the husband of former U.S. Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen . Early life and education [ edit ] Lehtinen is of Finnish ancestry . He graduated from the University of Miami in 1968 magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He then graduated with an MA from Columbia University and an MBA in 1974. In 1975, he graduated first in his class from Stanford Law School . At the University of Miami, he was the Commander of the Corps of Cadets, president of the Florida Federation of College Republicans, and was inducted into the Iron Arrow Honor Society , the highest owner bestowed at the university. [3] He joined the United States Army as an officer. He received a Purple Heart in 1971 for severe facial injuries during the Vietnam War . [2] [4] Florida legislature [ edit ] Dexter Lehtinen, Celia Cruz , Alonso R. del Portillo, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen , and Pedro Knight , May 1992 In 1980, Lehtinen ran against incumbent Democratic State Representative Gene Flinn in a multi-member southwest Dade County district. Lehtinen came in first in the Democratic primary, garnering 44% of the vote against Flinn and another candidate. [5] In the September primary runoff, Lehtinen defeated Flinn, 64 to 36%. [5] In the general election, he narrowly defeated Republican nominee Chris Ferrer with 51.3% of the vote. [6] In 1982, he won reelection in the newly redrawn 118th district—encompassing parts of rural southwestern Dade and areas stretching from Homestead to Richmond Heights —with 65%. [7] In 1984, he won reelection unopposed. In February 1985, he left the Democratic Party to become a Republican . This was only a few months before he married Republican State Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen . Lehtinen and his wife were both elected in 1986 to the Florida Senate ; he was elected in District 40—which included large parts of western and southwestern Dade, including parts of Coral Gables—and she was elected in neighboring District 34. [2] [8] U.S. Attorney for South Florida [ edit ] In June 1988, Lehtinen resigned his Florida Senate seat after U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese took a "high-risk gamble" [9] in naming him to succeed Leon Kellner as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] His three biggest cases during his 3 ½ year tenure were the cases of former Panama leader Manuel Noriega , [16] [17] [18] religious sect leader Yahweh ben Yahweh , [19] and of Hialeah Mayor Raúl L. Martínez . [20] The U.S. Senate refused to act on his nomination and Lehtinen on January 13, 1992, called a news conference to announce his resignation. [21] Lehtinen said his departure had nothing to do with a well-publicized internal Justice Department investigation of him because of the Martinez case. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] The Justice Department opened a case against Lehtinen on charges of misconduct and potential conflicts of interest for investigating "a potential political rival of his wife." [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] Post U.S. Attorney career [ edit ] Lehtinen served as the general counsel for the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida Indians [32] until May 2010. [33] In November 2011, the same tribe filed a lawsuit against Lehtinen for alleged malpractice regarding tax advice. [34] He also was a professor at University of Miami School of Law and at Florida International University . Personal life [ edit ] Lehtinen married then-Florida State Representative Ileana Ros on June 9, 1984, while they were both serving in the Florida House of Representatives . They have two children, Rodrigo and Patricia Marie. He was previously married to Donna L. Stevenson and had two children with her, Katharine Natasha and Douglas Hooper.
