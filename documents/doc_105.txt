It was released as the first single from the band's seventh studio album Raditude . Initially scheduled to be released to American rock radio on August 25, 2009, [2] the official release of the single to radio was moved up to August 18. The single debuted at number 21 on the Billboard Rock Songs Chart, and in the same position on the Alternative Songs chart. The music video features Odette Yustman . The song was first played live on August 23, 2009 in Toronto, Ontario at the Molson Amphitheatre . The main riff of this song bears a similarity to the main riff of The Jam song " Town Called Malice ". Reception [ edit ] "If You're Wondering If I Want You To (I Want You To)" has received positive reviews from Billboard Magazine [3] and Allmusic [ citation needed ] The song reached number 36 in the Triple J Hottest 100, 2009 . [4] Music video [ edit ] The music video was released on October 23. [5] Directed by Marc Webb , the music video revolves around the members of the band living a normal life until a beautiful lady played by Odette Yustman comes to the town. Her callousness and disregard leads to multiple band members being injured while trying to impress her, leaving only frontman Rivers Cuomo unhurt, though upon seeing his injured bandmates, Cuomo rejects the woman, to their approval. [6] "Marc Webb has created a kind of '50s small town for us to live in," Cuomo told MTV, "And basically it's just populated by the four members of Weezer. So we're just hanging out, driving around, filling up our trucks with gasoline. Basically being guys, and that's what Weezerville is like." [7] "The idea of the video is really simple: It's a town that's made up of clones of Weezer. There are multiple versions of Brian [Bell] and Patrick [Wilson] and Scott [Shriner] and Rivers, and they're just going about their business, until one day, this woman shows up," Webb continued. "And after that, everything basically goes to hell."
