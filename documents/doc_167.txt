[7] The album features the singles "Galaxy of the Lost", " Midnight Surprise " and " Tell Me What It's Worth ". [8] Recording [ edit ] Devonté Hynes, the main musician in Lightspeed Champion, flew to Omaha, Nebraska in early 2007 to flesh out the songs that he'd written with Mike Mogis , resident producer for Saddle Creek records and a member of Bright Eyes . He stayed there for several months in a guest house decorated by Mogis and Conor Oberst . An assortment of musicians came around to hang out and ended up playing on the record including Mogis himself, trumpet player and pianist Nate Walcott , The Faint 's drummer Clark Baechle and guest vocalist Emmy the Great —along with moonlighting members of Cursive and Tilly and the Wall . [9] According to Hynes, the album is in two-halves; a mixture of his dreams and life experiences. The lavender in the album title refers to a toy frog (made from lavender) Hynes' mother gave to him as a child to help him sleep.

"Xanadu" ( Olivia Newton-John cover) 3:46 Notes [ edit ] Hynes claims "I Could Have Done This Myself" is "about losing [his] virginity" going on to state, "which is why it's called I Could Have Done This Myself. I later realised that it was actually referring to the second time I had sex; the first time was so traumatic I'd just blanked it out of my memory." "Dry Lips" describes the last time Hynes - who has to lead a relatively sober life because of stomach ulcers - had a hangover. The 'Wendela' mentioned in the name of the final track ("No Surprise (For Wendela)") is a reference to Hynes' mother.
