It was released on the ARC / Columbia label in January 1981 as NJC 36986 (LP) and NCT 36986 (cassette). [1] It was distributed internationally by CBS as catalog no. 84880 (LP). Background [ edit ] In 1978 McMahon was chosen by Jerry Bruckheimer to provide the original songs (not the score) for the movie Defiance and when the movie was in post-production there was speculation that the project had potential for a soundtrack album. [2] When the movie premiered in February 1980 – its release was delayed to avoid possible competition with The Warriors [3] – the poster and some ads had the text “Original songs by Gerard McMahon”. [4] One of the songs McMahon wrote for the movie, “Bad Times”, was recorded by Tavares and became a minor hit peaking at number 47 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 64 on Cashbox Top 100 Singles in late February, 1980, [5] [6] and managed a peak of number 61 on the Record World Singles chart in early March. [7] McMahon also managed to get the song “Is That You” recorded by KISS for their 1980 album Unmasked . These relative successes led to a publishing deal with the newly formed Amazin’ Music run by former Billy Joel manager Irwin Mazur and, shortly thereafter, a record deal with ARC. [8] Track listing [ edit ] "Taxi (Nightdriver)" "Night Woman" "Gone Tomorrow" "Town Girls" "All I Really Need" "You Know Me Better Than I Do" "Run Into Your Shadow" "One More Goodbye" "Blind Love" "What've You Gotta Lose" Personnel [ edit ] Gerard McMahon – lead vocals, guitar, keyboards Gary Mallaber – drums, percussion, backing vocals John Massaro – guitar, keyboards, harmonica, backing vocals Al Campbell – keyboards, synthesizer Steve Sykes – lead guitar, guitar synthesizer Kenny Lewis – bass, backing vocals Producer – Gerard McMahon, Kid Lightning Chief Engineer – Joel Soifer Engineer – Bob Deeb Reception [ edit ] Critical reception of the album was varied. Some saw “the most intense, exceptional album of mainstream rock of the year”, one which contained “a hot string of hits”, [9] and featured the “mostt [sic.] ambitious writing heard this year from anybody”. [10] Others called it “a blustering, hollow debut […] a formula effort that fails to find the spark to catch fire”, [11] and a syndicated review from Rolling Stone claimed that the album showcased an “utter lack of emotion”. [12] Most reviewers mentioned a stylistic debt to Bruce Springsteen and/or Tom Petty. [9] [13] [14] Both Billboard and Cashbox noted that the material on the album should be accessible to both Top 40 and AOR radio formats, [15] [16] and critic Robert Hilburn included the album track “Town Girls” on his Alternative Top 10. [17] Despite this the album managed only minor airplay [18] [19] [20] [21] and several radio appearances in early April, 1981, failed to improve that. [22] [23] The album failed to chart on the Billboard Top 200. v t e Gerard McMahon Studio albums Gerard (1976) Row (1976) Blue Rue (1981) No Looking Back (1983) Foreign Papers (1986) G Tom Mac albums G Tom Mac (2000) Singles " Cry Little Sister " Related Discography References [ edit ] ^ Billboard 1981-01-24, p. 53 ^ Billboard 1979-03-03, p. 19 ^ The Tampa Tribune of Tampa, Florida 1980-02-01, section H p. 1 ^ Newsday of Melville, New York 1980-03-14, section II p. 4 ^ Billboard 1980-02-16, p. 94 ^ Cashbox 1980-02-23, p. 4 ^ Record World 1980-03-01, p. 25 ^ Billboard 1980-07-05, p. 27 ^ a b The Post Star of Glen Falls, New York 1981-03-14, Featurama section p. 5 ^ The Muncie Star of Muncie, Indiana 1981-05-17, section B p. 9 ^ Argus Leader of Sioux Falls, South Dakota 1981-03-19, p.
