It was launched in March 1964. Available as a roadster – bearing strong resemblance to the Honda S500 – and as a fastback coupé – introduced in March 1965 – the S600 was the first Honda available in two trim levels. [1] During its production run up to 1966, the model styling would remain pretty much the same, with the most notable changes coming to the front grille , bumper , and headlights . Specifications [ edit ] Powered by a DOHC , water-cooled , four-cylinder inline engine with four Keihin carburetors , the engine capacity was increased to 606 cc from the S500 's 531 cc. The engine produced 57 hp (43 kW) at 8,500 rpm and had a top speed of 90 mph (140 km/h). With the convertible weighing in at mere 1,576 lb (715 kg), the extra sheet metal of the coupe only added 33 lb (15 kg) to the overall weight. [2] [3] A four speed manual transmission drove the rear wheels via a hypoid differential outputting to chain final drives for each rear wheel. Each wheel was driven by either single or dual chains (depending on production date), contained in a pivoting, sealed case with oil bath lubrication and adjustable tensioners. These pivoting chain cases functioned as trailing arms for the fully independent, coil-sprung rear suspension. The front suspension was also independent, with a-arms, longitudinal torsion bar springs and rack-and-pinion steering. The S600 was equipped with 13" wheels and finned aluminum drum brakes. [3] [4] Production history [ edit ] The S600 was the first mass-marketed Honda car. First offered only in right-hand drive , it soon became available in left-hand drive to appeal to export markets. [1] There were a few pre-production S500s manufactured in left-hand drive, two or three even being shown in some early sales brochures. [ citation needed ] The S600 was the first Honda car sold in Europe. It was never officially sold in the United States, although a small number were imported by individual owners via Canada, Okinawa or Guam. [4] Both the S600 roadster and coupé were available in standard trim and a special, upgraded package called the SM600 which included, among other items, special paint colors, exclusive badging, a standard radio and speaker, a special antenna in the passenger side sun visor, standard reversing lights, a standard cigarette lighter, a standard heater, better-cushioned seats, and a detachable seat track for quick removal of the passenger seat. [1] Honda built 3,912 roadsters in 1964, with production climbing to 7,261 convertibles and 1,519 coupes in 1965. Production dropped off in 1966 (as they were shifting to the S800 ) with only 111 roadsters and 281 coupes, giving tallies of 11,284 convertibles and 1,800 coupes for the 3-year span.
