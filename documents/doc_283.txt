Dougherty Condition Ruined Ownership Public Public access Yes Bad-tibira ( Sumerian : 𒂦𒁾𒉄𒆠 , bad 3 -tibira ki ), "Wall of the Copper Worker(s)", [1] or "Fortress of the Smiths", [2] identified as modern Tell al-Madineh (also Tell Madineh), between Ash Shatrah and Tell as-Senkereh (ancient Larsa ) in southern Iraq , [3] was an ancient Sumerian city, which appears among antediluvian cities in the Sumerian King List . Its Akkadian name was Dûr-gurgurri . [4] It was also called Παντιβίβλος ( Pantibiblos ) by Greek authors such as Berossus , transmitted by Abydenus and Apollodorus . This may reflect another version of the city's name, Patibira , "Canal of the Smiths". [5] Bad-tibira in Sumerian literature [ edit ] According to the Sumerian King List , Bad-tibira was the second city to "exercise kingship" in Sumer before the flood, following Eridu . These kings were said to be En-men-lu-ana , En-men-gal-ana and Dumuzid the Shepherd . The early Sumerian text Inanna 's descent to the netherworld mentions the city's temple, E -mush-kalamma(a temple to Lulal ). In this tale, Inanna dissuades demons from the netherworld from taking Lulal , patron of Bad-tibira, who was living in squalor. They eventually take Dumuzid, who lived in palatial opulence at Uruk . This Dumuzid is called "the Shepherd", [6] who on the King List resides at Bad-Tibira in contrast to the post-diluvian Dumuzid, the Fisherman , who reigns in Uruk. History [ edit ] The "brotherhood text" in cuneiform inscriptions on cones plundered from the site in the 1930s records the friendship pact of Entemena , governor of Lagash , and Lugal-kinishedudu , governor of Uruk. It identifies Entemena as the builder of the temple E-mush [7] to Inanna and Dumuzid, under his local epithet Lugal -E-mush. [8] In the Isin-Larsa Period possession of the city passed between Larsa , whose king Sin-Iddinam claims to have built the great wall of Bad-tibira, and Isin , whose king Lipit-Ishtar , "the shepherd of Nippur ", claimed to have built the "House of Righteousness" there. [9] The city was under the control of Larsa during the long reign of Rim-Sîn I . [10] Archaeology [ edit ] The site was visited in 1927 by Raymond P. Dougherty for a day. He reports that the site covered about a square mile with the western mound being the largest with low extensions bearing off a mile to the north. Numbers baked bricks were seen along with door sockets, flint saw blades, and a bronze needle. [11] Some badly effaced half-bricks on the surface of the mound bore the inscription of Amar-Sin , of the Third Dynasty of Ur . Pieces of vitrified brick scattered over the surface of the large mound bore witness to the city's destruction by fire.

Crawford, "The Location of Bad-Tibira", Iraq 22 "Ur in Retrospect. In Memory of Sir C. Leonard Woolley" (Spring - Autumn 1960:197-199); the secure identification is based on the recovery at the pillaged site of fragments of a known inscription of Entemena that had surfaced in the black market without provenance . Earlier excavations at a mound called Medain near the site of Lagash , following a report of a vendor of one of the inscriptions, had proved fruitless: see H. de Genouillac, Fouilles de Telloh , ii:139 (noted by Crawford 1960:197 note 7). ^ Collection of taxes from Dûr-gurgurri features in correspondence of Hammurabi (first half of the 18th century BCE) noted in L. W. King and H. R.
