The tournament was held annually from 1992 to 2019, after which the NAIA consolidated its two divisions, returning to the single national championship for men's and women's basketball that it held between the event's establishment in 1937 and the division split in 1992. [1] Over its twenty-eight year history, the tournament was played in four different cities and at five different venues. Unlike the NCAA's annual basketball tournaments, where games are played at an assortment of regional sites over the course of several weeks, all NAIA tournament games were played at a single, centralized arena. [2] [3] [4] [5] Bethel (IN) , Cornerstone , Indiana Wesleyan , and Oregon Tech won the most NAIA Division II national titles, with three each.
