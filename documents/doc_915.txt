Celebrity Apex was scheduled to begin operations in April 2020, but entry into service was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic . Her inaugural sailing was on June 21, 2021. A Fourth ship is currently under construction. Celebrity Ascent is tentatively debuting 4th Quarter 2023. Both Celebrity Edge and Celebrity Apex are built with a gross tonnage (GT) of 130,818.

[5] In June 2015, the letter was converted into a formal order for the first two ships. [6] On 25 May 2016, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. announced that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with STX France for two additional ships for the Edge class. [7] These two vessels comprise the third and fourth in the class, scheduled for delivery in fall 2021 and 2022, respectively. [7] On 11 April 2019, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. ordered a fifth Edge -class ship with Chantiers de l'Atlantique, with delivery scheduled for fall 2024. [8] Construction [ edit ] Celebrity Cruises marked the beginning of construction for the first Edge -class vessel with the steel-cutting ceremony on 21 November 2016 at the STX France shipyard. [9] On the same day, the lead vessel's name was announced as Celebrity Edge . [10] She was delivered on 31 October 2018. [11] Celebrity initially named the second vessel of the Edge class as Celebrity Beyond , [9] but she was renamed Celebrity Apex on the day of her steel-cutting on 23 July 2018.
