The series started in 1987 with The Curse before ending with Curse IV: The Ultimate Sacrifice in 1993 (It is notable due to the fact the last film Curse IV: The Ultimate Sacrifice was originally made in 1988, predating the third film Curse III: The Ultimate Sacrifice which was released in 1990). The only loose connections between the films are the first two are Italian productions produced by Ovidio G. Assonitis , otherwise the films are completely unrelated. Films [ edit ] The Curse (1987) [ edit ] Main article: The Curse (1987 film) Principal photography began on September 29, 1986, under the title The Farm , after being announced previously as The Well . David Keith , a native of Knoxville , utilized his farm property in Tellico Plains, Tennessee for the film, while the interiors were shot in Rome . [1] [2] Many of the crew members, who were Italian, were billed under American names, including associate producer Lucio Fulci . [1] Actor Treat Williams was reportedly set to star in the film, but was not involved with the film itself. [1] The Curse opened in Los Angeles and New York on September 11, 1987. [1] It earned $1,169,922 from its opening weekend in 326 theaters, and finished grossing $1,930,001 at the box office . [3] The film went on to be a major home video success in the rental market causing three unrelated films to be retitled as sequels. Curse II: The Bite (1989) [ edit ] Main article: Curse II: The Bite Originally filmed with the title The Bite , the film was later retitled Curse II: The Bite by the American distributors, who had also bought the rights to two Italian Ovidio G. Assonitis , this and Beyond the Door III . The film was retitled to capitalize on the home video success of The Curse . [4] [5] Curse III: Blood Sacrifice (1990) [ edit ] Main article: Curse III: Blood Sacrifice Originally filmed with the title Panga , it would eventually be retitled as Curse III: Blood Sacrifice by the American distributors, RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video . The film was released direct-to-video in 1990. [6] Internationally it has been released under its original title Panga [7] and simply Blood Sacrifice . Fangoria gave the film a negative review stating "There was The Curse , then Curse II: The Bite , and now Curse III , obvious right? Unfortunately the same brand of elementary thinking went into the plotting of this newest Curse epic." [8] Curse IV: The Ultimate Sacrifice (1993) [ edit ] Main article: Catacombs (1988 film) The film was the last officially completed film by Empire Pictures under the title Catacombs and shown at the Cannes Film Festival on May 14, 1988, before the company and film was seized by Crédit Lyonnais for failure to pay on loans. [9] As a result, the film's release was delayed for five years. It was eventually given the new title Curse IV: The Ultimate Sacrifice by Columbia TriStar Home Video and was released direct-to-video on VHS in 1993.
