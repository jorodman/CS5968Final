[5] McMillan wrote the libretto for The Arsonists , the world's first opera written in a South Yorkshire dialect, which received its premiere on 18 November 2017.

McMillan hosts the weekly show The Verb and Proms variation Adverb on BBC Radio 3 , "dedicated to investigating spoken words around the globe". [6] He has been described in the BBC's publication Radio Times as the " 22nd Most Powerful Person in Radio ". [ citation needed ] He is also a regular roving contributor to Radio 4's Today Programme where he was at one stage dubbed as the programme's "Election Laureate". He co-wrote the Radio 4 comedy series Street and Lane with Dave Sheasby which first aired 2005–2007 and has since been repeated. [7] During January 2007, he presented a BBC Radio 3 series on writing, Ian McMillan's Writing Lab , in which he talked to a range of authors which included Julian Barnes , Mark Ravenhill , Howard Jacobson and Michael Rosen .

In December 2006, McMillan judged the "Central Trains Poetry Competition" and the winners, from the Royal Grammar School Worcester , were awarded a signed copy of his poem "Take me on a Christmas Trip on Central Trains " at Birmingham Snow Hill station . [8] [9] [10] He was also a judge in the Foyle Young Poets Awards 2008, and went as a teacher with the winners for a week to The Hurst, an Arvon centre in Shropshire, as part of their prize. [11] He judged the 2009 Cardiff International Poetry Competition for the award ceremony in June.

McMillan contributed a foreword and two original pieces, "Here.Now.Then" and "The Laureate Reflects" as well as co-authoring (with six regional writers) "Three Cities Chain Poem". [12] Yorkshire dialect work [ edit ] In 2007, McMillan published a book named Collins Chelp and Chunter: a Guide to the Tyke Tongue . This was a compilation of words that are used in the Yorkshire dialect as well as a few pieces of Yorkshire humour and illustrations. The book received a negative review in the Transactions of the Yorkshire Dialect Society in 2019, which noted that the work had an inconsistent orthography, assigned words to very specific locations when they were spread over wider areas and did not take account of the historical development of the dialect. [13] In celebration of the UK's 2012 National Pie Week, Ian McMillan wrote a 'piem' devoted to the creations of the 'pie village' of Denby Dale , which has produced several world record breaking pies over the last 250 years.
