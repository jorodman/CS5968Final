They were also used as the main battery on the St. Louis -class protected cruisers . [1] [2] Design [ edit ] The 6-inch (152 mm)/50 caliber Mark 6 guns were developed around the time of the Spanish–American War . The gun card designates the gun as 46-caliber but the Bureau of Ordnance lists the guns as 50-caliber. [1] [2] The Mark 6 gun was constructed of gun steel using a tube , jacket, four hoops , a locking ring, and Welin breech block . It was discovered that the pressure curve of the charge and the strength curve of the barrel match exactly along one point of the barrel, because of this the muzzle velocity was reduced from the original 2,800 ft/s (850 m/s) to 2,600 ft/s (790 m/s). With the Mod 1 nickel-steel was used for the tube, two hoops and the locking ring, the gun was also hooped to the muzzle, because of this, the original muzzle velocity was able to be restored. The Mod 2 were Mod 0s with a hoop added to the chase along with a cylindrical liner made from nickel-steel. With these changes the original muzzle velocity was used. [1] [2] The Mark 8 was similar to the Mark 6 Mod 1 but was constructed entirely out of nickel steel. The Mod 1 had a slightly smaller diameter chamber, but the same volume. The Mod 2 had its rifling grooves increased to 36 from 24 and didn't have the modified chamber of the Mod 1. The Mod 3 had a cylindrical liner made of nickel-steel along with a new chamber design and 36 grooves. Mod 4 used an earlier gun that had its liner replaced with a conical nickel-steel liner along with 36 grooves and the chamber of the Mod 3. [1] [2] This gun is also unusual for the US Navy where the overall length of the gun barrel , 300.2 in (7,630 mm), is used to measure the caliber of the gun. (i.e.:300.2/6=50) Normally the bore length , 294 in (7,500 mm), would be used and this would actually be a 49 caliber gun. (i.e.:294/6=49) [1] Naval Service [ edit ] Ship Gun Installed Gun Mount USS Maine (BB-10) Mark 6: 6"/50 caliber Mark 10: 16 × single mounts USS Missouri (BB-11) Mark 6: 6"/50 caliber Mark 10: 16 × single mounts USS Ohio (BB-12) Mark 6: 6"/50 caliber Mark 10: 16 × single mounts USS Virginia (BB-13) Mark 6: 6"/50 caliber Mark 10: 12 × single mounts USS Nebraska (BB-14) Mark 6: 6"/50 caliber Mark 10: 12 × single mounts USS Georgia (BB-15) Mark 6: 6"/50 caliber Mark 10: 12 × single mounts USS New Jersey (BB-16) Mark 6: 6"/50 caliber Mark 10: 12 × single mounts USS Rhode Island (BB-17) Mark 6: 6"/50 caliber Mark 10: 12 × single mounts USS St. Louis (C-20) Mark 6: 6"/50 caliber Mark 10: 14 × single mounts USS Milwaukee (C-21) Mark 8: 6"/50 caliber Mark 10: 14 × single mounts USS Charleston (C-22) Mark 6: 6"/50 caliber Mark 10: 14 × single mounts USS Pennsylvania (ACR-4) Mark 6: 6"/50 caliber Mark 10: 14 × single mounts USS West Virginia (ACR-5) Mark 6: 6"/50 caliber Mark 10: 14 × single mounts USS California (ACR-6) Mark 6: 6"/50 caliber Mark 10: 14 × single mounts USS Colorado (ACR-7) Mark 6: 6"/50 caliber Mark 10: 14 × single mounts USS Maryland (ACR-8) Mark 6: 6"/50 caliber Mark 10: 14 × single mounts USS South Dakota (ACR-9) Mark 6: 6"/50 caliber Mark 10: 14 × single mounts USS Tennessee (ACR-10) Mark 8: 6"/50 caliber Mark 10: 14 × single mounts USS Washington (ACR-11) Mark 8: 6"/50 caliber Mark 10: 14 × single mounts USS North Carolina (ACR-12) Mark 8: 6"/50 caliber Mark 10: 14 × single mounts USS Montana (ACR-13) Mark 8: 6"/50 caliber Mark 10: 14 × single mounts The Maine s had their guns reduced to eight in 1909, the guns would go on to arm auxiliary ships during World War I and again in World War II. After WW I, and as a result of the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty , many of these ships were scrapped; the guns were later put to use as coastal artillery . [1] Coast defense locations [ edit ] 6"/50 caliber ex-Navy guns were emplaced during World War II at numerous locations; most were operated by the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps . This list may not be exhaustive. They were grouped into two-gun batteries unless otherwise noted. Most of the batteries in CONUS were disestablished in 1943 as new defenses were built or the threat abated.
