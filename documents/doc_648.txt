[1] [2] [3] History [ edit ] A 1903 Railway Clearing House map of railways in the vicinity of Castle Bytham (left). Midland Railway in green; M&GN in yellow. This station was rather unusual, being a single platform in a cutting through the village. The station was not originally planned by the railway, but was added after considerable local lobbying. Outside the village, the line of the railway now forms a road crossing under the A1 . The line officially became M&GN property a few miles east at Little Bytham Junction, where it crossed the Great Northern Railway main line. The GNR had powers to make a junction here but never did so. The nearest station on the GNR was Little Bytham .
