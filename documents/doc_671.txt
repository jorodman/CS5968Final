Painted in 1912, Goldfish was part of a series that Matisse produced between the spring and early summer of 1912. Background [ edit ] In the early 1900s, Matisse established himself as a leader of the Fauvism art movement. [1] Fauvism emphasised a strong use of color and painterly qualities, as opposed to realistic representations found in Impressionist art. In 1912, Matisse visited Tangier , Morocco , where he noted how the locals would be fascinated by goldfish swimming in bowls. [2] Shortly after his visit to Morocco, Matisse produced a series of paintings that included Goldfish between the spring and early summer. [2] Goldfish was painted in Matisse's garden conservatory at his home in Issy-les-Moulineaux . [2] He moved there to escape the pressures of Paris . Description and composition [ edit ] The 1912 Goldfish painting was unlike other Matisse works featuring goldfish , as the goldfish themselves are the focus of the piece. [2] Matisse continued the use of bright colours found in his Fauvist work on Goldfish . The painting features a "bright orange [that] strongly contrasts with the more subtle pinks and greens that surround the fish bowl and the blue-green background." [2] A still life , the painting features "Matisse's own plants, his own garden furniture, and his own fish tank." [2] Additionally, Matisse's "depiction of space" in the piece creates a tension. The goldfish can be seen from two different angles simultaneously: from the front, where the viewer can immediately recognise them, and from above, where they are "merely suggested by colorful brushstrokes." [2] Themes and analysis [ edit ] Smarthistory wrote that Goldfish is "an illustration of some of the major themes in Matisse's painting: his use of complementary colors, his quest for an idyllic paradise, his appeal for contemplative relaxation for the viewer and his complex construction of pictorial space." [2] Provenance and legacy [ edit ] The motif of fish in aquariums was notable in his work and would become a recurring sight from in the early and mid-1910s. [3] [4] [5] The piece was purchased by Sergei Shchukin in Paris from Matisse's studio in 1912, and was a part of Shchukin's Pink Drawing Room ensemble in his home. [3] Since 1948, the work has been located at the Pushkin Museum in Moscow , Russia. [3] Goldfish holds the distinction of being the featured Matisse work found in the College Board 's AP Art History curriculum. [2] References [ edit ] ^ Smith, Roberta (30 November 2012).
