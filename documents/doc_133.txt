Career [ edit ] In college, she competed for the University of Pittsburgh from 1996–1999 and was a seven-time NCAA national champion (two outdoor and three indoor long jump titles and one outdoor and one indoor triple jump title), 15-time All-American, a 14-time Big East Conference champion, and a 15-time Eastern College Athletic Conference champion. Trecia was named to the NCAA Division 1 Silver Anniversary Indoor Team and a "NCAA Division 1 Most Outstanding Student-Athlete". [1] [2] Her personal best is 15.16 metres, and she almost equalled that result at the 2005 World Championships where she, in the absence of Golden League winner Tatyana Lebedeva , won the gold medal with 15.11 metres. Smith won triple jump at the 2009 Jamaican Championship with 14.43 m, qualifying for her fifth World Championships in Athletics . [3] She retained her Commonwealth triple jump title at the 2010 Commonwealth Games , and she was given the David Dixon Award for her performance. The decision was a surprise in many quarters as she had only one legal jump at the competition, a modest mark of 14.19 m which she herself acknowledged was "a terrible jump". Alicia Coutts , who emerged with five swimming gold medals, was among the athletes Smith was chosen ahead of.
