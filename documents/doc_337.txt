Competing against several other sanctioning bodies, including NASCAR , NSCRA was considered to be the most significant challenge to NASCAR's dominance of the sport; however it proved incapable of competing with the larger sanction, and closed down midway through the 1951 racing season. History [ edit ] Founded in 1946 in Atlanta, Georgia by Sam Nunis and Weyman Milam , [1] the NSCRA was one of many small sanctioning bodies that appeared following the end of World War II to promote the fledgling sport of stock car racing. [2] Participating, along with the U.S. Stock Car Drivers Association and Bill France's National Championship Stock Car Circuit , in a decision to declare a consensus national champion for stock cars in 1946, [3] it remained a largely informal group, operating as a sanction for modified stock car racing , until O. Bruton Smith of Charlotte, North Carolina assumed responsibility for the group in 1948. [4] Smith announced that the sanction would operate a "Strictly Stock" championship starting in 1949; [4] he offered lucrative purse money in an attempt to cherry-pick the stars of France's NASCAR, which had been founded in 1947 to replace the NCSCC and was running its first modified season in 1948. [5] [N 1] In direct competition, France announced his own Strictly Stock race, running it at Charlotte Speedway in June 1949 - a direct poke in the eye to Smith and NSCRA, as Charlotte was Smith's hometown. [7] The NSCRA Strictly Stock Championship ran for two years, with Ed Samples , a former moonshiner , winning the series title in 1949; Buddy Shuman , who had won the NSCRA modified title in 1948, took the series' stock car championship trophy in 1950. [8] In late 1950, seeing as how the sport was still on a shaky basis and could not support two major sanctioning bodies, Smith and France agreed in principle to merge their respective organizations into a single, unified promotional body for the sport. [9] However, Smith was drafted in January 1951 to fight in the Korean War as a paratrooper ; [10] in his absence, NSCRA's management, dominated by drivers, proved incapable of keeping the organization afloat amongst internal disputes, [11] and Milam was forced to close down the sanctioning body during the summer of 1951. [12] Samples was leading the NSCRA's point standings at the time of the closure. [13] The circuit's premier drivers, such as Cotton Owens , and tracks, such as Lakewood Speedway , joined NASCAR following NSCRA's closure. [12] References [ edit ] Notes ^ "National Stock Car Racing Association" had actually been the preferred name selected for the new sanctioning body created by France in 1947 at the Streamline Hotel in Daytona Beach, Florida ; Red Vogt pointed out that the name was already in use, suggesting "National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing" as an alternative, which was accepted.
