Background [ edit ] This was Marcus's second album for Justin Time Records . [3] Recording and music [ edit ] Of the nine tracks, seven are originals. [3] Marcus mostly plays saxello and stritch (types of straight saxophone) on the album. [1] On the " Giant Steps " and " Naima " medley, he plays bass clarinet. [1] Release [ edit ] The album was released by Justin Time on June 10, 1997. [4] Reception [ edit ] The AllMusic reviewer commented that Byard had a largely supporting role, so "although this CD will probably be quite important in the discography of Michael Marcus, it is just a footnote, a lost opportunity, in Jaki Byard's career." [1] The JazzTimes reviewer praised Marcus's tone on the rarely played saxophones.
