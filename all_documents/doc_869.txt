Marketed primarily as a video game console, it is compatible with other Atari 8-bit computer software and peripherals and functions as a home computer. [1] [2] [3] This list contains games released during the XEGS's lifetime, all of which use "Atari XE Video Game Cartridge" packaging. [1] [4] Many are earlier diskette -based releases converted to ROM cartridge . Some XEGS cartridges do not work the Atari 400 and 800, because they need 64K RAM or another feature of the XL and XE 8-bit computer models.
