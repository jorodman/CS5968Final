He was selected with the tenth pick of the sixth round of the 2004 NFL Draft by the Houston Texans to play safety. He finished his pro football career playing at wide receiver and cornerback for the Indoor Football League (IFL)'s Abilene Ruff Riders in 2007. Early life [ edit ] Lord was born in the Bed-Stuy section of Brooklyn and moved to Bayonne, New Jersey after his father was killed in Panama . He learned option-style football as a nine-year-old quarterback on the local Pop Warner team. He went on to high school where he was a first-team all state quarterback along with Chris Simms . Lord played high school football at Bayonne High School, [1] where he was also a three-year starter on the basketball team. [2] Collegiate career [ edit ] Lord played quarterback at the University of Nebraska and ran the Huskers' option -style offense of the era. Jammal's athleticism allowed him to excel as a double-threat quarterback, although his passing ability was criticized. As a starting quarterback, he directed his Nebraska teams to 7-7 and 10-3 records during the 2002 and 2003 seasons respectively. At 6-2, 220-pounds with good speed (4.5 40 yard dash), Lord was bullish rushing and passing for 2,774 yards in 2002 and for 2,253 yards in 2003. One of Lord's memorable moments as a Husker came when his career as a starting quarterback was under fire during his junior year. Having been demoted from the first-team offense during the week of practice leading up to the October 5, 2002 game with McNeese State , Lord took it on his own to pick up the slack for his struggling offense. After finding out he was still the team's starting quarterback not long before kickoff time, Lord made the most of it. He finished the game with 17 rushes for 218 yards including touchdown runs of 5, 57, and 56 yards and also went 12-of-18 passing the ball for 151 yards which set a new Husker school record for rushing yards by a quarterback and total yards (369). [3] The total yards record is now held by Joe Ganz (528 against Kansas State in 2007) and the rushing record for a quarterback is now held by Taylor Martinez (241 against Kansas State in 2010).
