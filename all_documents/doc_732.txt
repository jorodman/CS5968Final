His role in this judgment meant that he appeared in an infamous front-cover of the Daily Mail ( Enemies of the People ), and in a move which was widely seen as attacking his homosexuality , the Mail Online chastised Etherton for being an "openly-gay ex-Olympic fencer". [11] [12] [13] [14] The reference was swiftly removed, though without apology. In June 2019, Etherton, Sir Stephen Irwin and Sir Rabinder Singh found that ministers had breached British law when they "made no concluded assessments of whether the Saudi -led coalition had committed violations of international humanitarian law in the past, during the Yemen conflict , and made no attempt to do so."
