A political group also known as a political alliance, coalition or bloc, is cooperation by members of different political parties on a common agenda of some kind. This usually involves formal agreements between two or more entire parties. A political group is usually especially beneficial to the parties concerned during and immediately after elections – due to characteristics of the electoral systems concerned (e.g. allowing each party to clear electoral thresholds ) and/or allowing parties to participate in formation of a government after elections. These may break up quickly, or hold together for decades becoming the de facto norm, operating almost as a single unit. Political group may also form prior to elections in an effort to reduce uncertainty following the election. [1] Coalition governments are formed when a political group comes to power, or when only a plurality (not a majority ) has been reached and several parties must work together to govern. One of the peculiarities of such a method of governance results in minister without portfolio .
