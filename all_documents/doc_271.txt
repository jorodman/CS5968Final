'He who is contented with God'), [2] was the eighth Nasrid ruler of the Emirate of Granada in Al-Andalus on the Iberian Peninsula . Muhammad V was the eldest son and heir of Yusuf I by his slave Butayna, born on Sunday, 4 January 1339. He also had a younger full-blood sister, A'isha, two half brothers and five half-sisters. He ruled between 1354–1359 and 1362–1391, and is best known for completing the royal palace of the Alhambra with the Palace of the Lions and the Mexuar , or Cuarto Dorado . Sultan [ edit ] He inherited the throne from Yusuf I but was overthrown in August 1359 by his half-brother Ismail II and sought protection with the Marinid sultan of Fez , where Muhammad was inspired with fresh examples of architecture. Isma'il was overthrown and murdered with his brother Qays less than a year later in 1360, by his brother-in-law, Abu Said, who ruled as Muhammad VI but was overthrown in turn by Muhammad V, who returned to the throne for another 29 years. During the three-year period of the reign of Muhammad VI , Muhammad V was plotting his return to power. A chance came in 1362 when King Peter I of Castile (Pedro el Cruel) lured Muhammad VI to his kingdom. There, in Seville, he was murdered and his head sent to Muhammad V as a gift upon his return to the throne. As a gesture of good relations between him and the Marinid, the eldest son of Muhammad V, Yusuf II , married to a daughter of the Marinid Sultan. In 1365, Sultan Muhammed V had the Maristan of Granada at the foot of his Alhambra palace built - it was one of the earliest European hospitals that also included care for the mentally ill. [3] He employed the poet and diplomat Ibn Khaldun in negotiations with Pedro the Cruel . Death [ edit ] Muhammad V died on 16 January 1391. He had at least four sons; Yusuf II , Nasr, Muhammad and Sa'd. He was succeeded by his son, Yusuf II.
