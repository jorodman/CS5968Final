The species is endemic to the southwestern part of Western Australia . [5] The species has been successfully bred in captivity in Cologne Zoological Garden . While all turtles are popularly believed to be mute, the oblong turtle is known to have a wide range of vocalizations. [6] Etymology [ edit ] The specific name , colliei , is in honor of Scottish physician and naturalist Alexander Collie . [7] Taxonomic history [ edit ] This species has a very complicated taxonomic history, involving many uses of the available names and a number of mistakes in that usage. [8] [9] In his original concept of the two species involved Gray 1841 [2] and 1856 [3] clearly diagnosed two species, one from northern and one from southwestern Australia. However these were considered a single wide-ranging species by Boulenger 1889. [10] This mistaken concept was followed for some time but was reviewed by Burbidge (1967). [11] Unfortunately they had mixed the names up as was brought out first by Thomson (2000) [8] and has been summarised also by Kuchling (2010). [9] A submission to the ICZN was put in by Thomson (2006) [12] to maintain the prevailing usage of Chelodina rugosa over the name Chelodina oblonga for the northern snake-necked turtle with further comments by several authors. In 2013 the ICZN handed down its opinion [13] on the issue where they deemed that the Principle of Priority should be followed. According to that ruling, the correct name for the northern snake-necked turtle was Chelodina oblonga and for the south-western snake-necked turtle is Chelodina colliei . Although that ruling required considerable effort over the ensuing 12 months to establish this nomenclature, subsequent research has reversed this finding with respect to Chelodina oblonga . Kehlmaier et al. (2019) [14] analyzed mitochondrial genomes of key type specimens and resolved several questions regarding taxonomy and nomenclature. They declared Chelodina oblonga a nomen dubium , affirmed Chelodina colliei as the southwestern snake-necked turtle, and called for the name Chelodina rugosa Ogilby, 1890 to be restored to the northern snake-necked turtle. This finding was supported by the findings of Shea et al. (2020) that the supposed holotype of Chelodina oblonga was in fact part of a type series and molecular work showed it was in fact from Perth. This led to a more detailed examination of its history and the determination that it was indeed the southwestern snake-necked turtle. [4] Thus, the correct name scientific names are Chelodina oblonga for the southwestern snake-necked turtle and Chelodina rugosa for the northern snake-necked turtle.
