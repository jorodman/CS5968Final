The national team has entered five EuroBasket Women finals, the first in 1978 where they lost all of their matches and finished in 13th place. At the EuroBasket Women 1987 Sweden finished in 7th place, a feat repeated in 2013 . In 2019 Sweden reached the quarter-finals and was ranked 5th, a result that secured a spot in the 2020 Olympic qualifying tournament . Comparing with earlier decades, Sweden improved significantly during the 2010s. This was much thanks to the "Golden Generation" who won medals in junior championships on both European and World levels.
