CFL News in 1975 [ edit ] Calgary became the first city in the Canadian Prairie Provinces to host the Grey Cup championship game. The CFL changed the rules on blocking by allowing contact to be above waist level on punt returns. The two-point convert was introduced to the league, as was the option after a field goal attempt by one team (regardless of whether it was made or not) to let the opposing team either kick off or scrimmage from their own 35-yard line (the latter option was eliminated in 2009, but was reinstated the next year). Tragedy struck the CFL on October 11, when Hamilton Tiger-Cats star defensive lineman Tom Pate suffered an aneurysm in the fourth quarter against the Stampeders at McMahon Stadium . Pate never regains consciousness and would in two days die, at the age of 23. A year later, the CFLPA announced the Tom Pate Memorial Award in his honour to be awarded to the player who best personifies a unique combination of outstanding sportsmanship and dedication to the league and the community.
