Gray Peak is southwest of Mt. Marcy and southeast of Mount Colden. [3] It was named for Asa Gray by Verplanck Colvin . [4] Gray Peak is most frequently climbed from Lake Tear of the Clouds , with approaches via Elk Lake or Upper Works. Gray is the highest peak in the Adirondacks without a maintained and marked trail. [1] This fact, combined with the somewhat limited view from Gray's summit, means that it is less frequently climbed than many shorter peaks. References [ edit ] ^ a b c "Gray Peak, New York" .
