She has released two albums of bass music on Hyperdub : Playin' Me (2012) and Wait 'Til Night (2014). [1] [2] Music [ edit ] Her full-length albums "explore more complex, difficult and polarising emotional frequencies than can possibly [be] visited on her club-ready EP output." [3] Singles and EPs from 2008 onwards have encompassed UK funky , [4] [5] [6] jungle , [7] garage , grime , deep house and dub . [8] Alexis Petridis in The Guardian described her debut album Playin' Me (2012) thus: "You hear fragments of lover's rock, dubstep, Soul II Soul, drum'n'bass, UK funky and Massive Attack's stoned melancholy: the end result sounds unearthly, alternately scattered and luscious, and ultimately like no one else. Her vocals – unreconstructed south-London accent, beautifully understated style, lyrics that trace the arc of a relationship going wrong – bring it back down to earth." [9] A review in the NME concurs that "'Playin' Me' develops the UK funky sound she's been pushing for years, with its devastating sub-bass, raindrop drums and warm vocals. Within those vocals is a pop edge, and some of her lyrics could be cut straight from the Top 40 [ . . .] But the best thing about 'Playin' Me' is that for all its futuristic swirl, it's a record about living in London in 2012." [10] Petridis praised the inclusion of a cover of " Trouble " by Coldplay, where as the NME was critical of it. [9] [10] Paul MacInnes in The Guardian described second album Wait 'Til Night (2014) as " bass -driven hip hop ; and a lyrical theme, lust." [7] In 2010, Cooly G set up a record label, Dub Organizer, a name she had previously used for a series of CD-R releases. [11] She played Boiler Room DJ sets in London in 2014 and 2018. [12] [13] She has "taught sound engineering and held music production and DJ workshops for disaffected teens." [14] [10] Personal life [ edit ] Campbell was born in Brixton , South London. [15] She is a single mother to two children. [16] [17] They lost all their belongings in a fire on 31 December 2018. Campbell had been using a temporary storage lock up in Croydon, which was destroyed in a fire, having abandoned their home after a flood and whilst waiting to move.
